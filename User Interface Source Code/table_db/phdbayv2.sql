The current study which stems from (MISC) cohort was conducted from December 2015 and ended in June 2016 in the Emirates of Sharjah, Dubai and Ajman of United Arab Emirates (UAE). A total of 256 healthy pregnant Arab women aged 19 to 40 years with singleton pregnancy were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. Participants were interviewed once during pregnancy, then at delivery, at two and 6 months postpartum in the primary health care clinics. The data collected for the mothers included socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, dietary intake, and anthropometry upon recruitment and during the postnatal visits while for infants, anthropometric measurements, and feeding practices. Further, blood and breast milk samples were collected at birth from the mothers and at 6 months postpartum for the mothers and the infants. These included fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, lipid profile as well as High Molecular Weight Human Adiponectin (HMW) ADPN; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and High Sensitivity C Reactive protein (hs-CRP). In addition to the breast milk profile of adiponectin and hs-CRP. Descriptive analysis revealed a marked prevalence of excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) (39.1%) among the participant mothers and was prominent among overweight and obese mothers (53.9% and 48.7%) respectively. Besides, their diet quality index score was less than the optimum. At 6 months, multiple linear regression (MLR) revealed that postpartum weight retention (PPWR) decreased with increasing pre pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (Î²=-.43, p<0.01) and increased with increasing gestational weight gain (GWG) (Î²=.391, p<0.001), while serum FBS was the only metabolite parameter associated with retaining weight (Î²= 0.113, p<0.05).

(4, 'Norliyana Binti Aris', 'Risk factors of vitamin D deficiency and the effects of sunlight exposure and vitamin D supplementation on serum vitamin D level, adiponectin, cardiometabolic risk factors and metabolic syndrome among adults in Kelantan', 'In spite of abundant sunshine for cutaneous vitamin D (VD) synthesis, low levels of VD have been documented among Malaysian population. However, the effects of occupational sunlight exposure and monsoon seasons on VD are not well established. Besides, low VD levels has been associated with several non-bone or calcium-related outcomes including metabolic syndrome (MetS), which may mediated by adiponectin. This study was divided into two phases. Phase 1, a comparative crosssectional study was conducted to characterize the effect of occupational sunlight exposure and monsoon season on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and identify factors modifying the serum 25(OH)D levels. Besides, the relationship between 25(OH)D levels with high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin and cardiometabolic risk factors were also observed. Phase 2, a quasi-experimental study was carried out for 12 weeks to evaluate the effects of moderate sunlight exposure (sunlight exposure group; 15 minutes sunlight exposure biweekly on face, arms, hands and feet; n=19), VD supplementation (VD supplement group, 50 000 IU cholecalciferol weekly, n=15] and placebo (placebo group, n=15) on serum 25(OH)D, HMW adiponectin and cardiometabolic risk factors in women with VD deficiency (serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l). Both phases were carried out among Malay working adults in Kelantan from 2012 to 2015. Outcome measures comprises of anthropometric measurements (height, weight and waist circumference), body fat percentage and blood pressure assessment, fasting blood test (25(OH)D, HMW adiponectin, lipid profile, glucose, insulin and hs- CRP) and questionnaire (socio-demographic, medical history, sunlight exposure and sun protection use, physical activity assessment and VD intake). In phase 1, two-point data were collected in 138 outdoor and 143 indoor workers, first in non-monsoon (May-June 2012) and second in monsoon season (Jan-Feb 2013). Results of phase 1 study revealed that serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly higher in outdoor workers compared to indoor workers irrespective of season and sex (p<0.001). Furthermore, significant association between VD status and occupation was observed (p<0.001). Monsoonal differences of 25(OH)D was observed only in male outdoor workers (mean difference, MD = 10.39 nmol/l, p<0.001). However, in overall, no significant association was found between VD status and monsoon season (Ï‡2(1)=0.076, p=0.783). Serum 25(OH)D level was directly predicted by hours of sunlight exposure (Î²=0.38, p=0.010) and inversely by sun protection score (Î²=-4.64, p=0.001), body mass index (Î²=-1.02, p=0.002), indoor occupation (Î²=-42.72, p<0.001) and female sex (Î²=-19.46, p<0.001). No significant relationship between VD with HMW adiponectin and cardiometabolic risk factors were found in this study (p>0.05). Considering the results of determinants of VD in Phase 1, female indoor workers with VD deficiency in both monsoon and non-monsoon seasons were recruited for phase 2 study. In phase 2, after 12 week of intervention, serum 25(OH)D increased significantly in sunlight exposure (MD = 14.27 nmol/l, p<0.001) and VD supplement group (MD = 14.30 nmol/l, p<0.001) but not in placebo group (MD = 1.63 nmol/l, p=0.067). Significant increase in HMW adiponectin was observed only in VD supplement group (MD=0.43 ng/ml, p=0.024). Among the MetS components, only glucose decreased significantly after 12 weeks of sunlight exposure (MD=-0.27 mmol/l, p<0.001) but no changes seen in the other groups. No significant changes were found in waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides and other cardiometabolic risk factors in all groups after 12 weeks. However, HDL-C was found increased significantly in all groups after the intervention (p<0.05). In conclusion, both moderate sunlight exposure and VD supplement interventions improved the VD levels, but the effects of VD on HMW adiponectin and cardiometabolic risk factors are still inconclusive.', 'vitamin d sunlight supplementation', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Sains Kesihatan (School of Health Sciences) ', '2020', 0),

In the present study, it was of interest to know the specific difficulties faced by Muslims when performing their daily tasks (including solat) and whether the conventional vestibular rehabilitation would be effective in reducing the symptoms. This is a mixed-design study with three consecutive phases. In the first phase, triggering and/or worsening factors to vestibular symptoms were determined. In the subsequent phases, a mixed-convergent study design was employed, i.e., quantitative (VHIT, cVEMP and MyVRBQ) and qualitative (in-depth interview) methods. Of 91 respondents, 68% reported that their symptoms were triggered by body and head movements. Nearly half of them reported at least one prayer movement triggered and/or worsened their symptoms. In the second phase of the study, despite normal findings from VHIT and cVEMP (except for P13 and N23 latencies), MyVRBQ showed that the participants were affected by the symptoms. Content analysis unveiled five content areas: 1) Common symptoms, 2) Effects on general activities, 3) Effects on performing solat, 4) Conditions that may exacerbate and/or provoke vestibular symptoms, 5) Compensatory strategies to overcome and/or hinder from having the symptoms. Following rehabilitation, significant reductions in MyVRBQ scores were seen in all categories (as early as two weeks). Two content areas were discovered: 1) Improvements in general activities, and 2) Improvements in solat. While the objective assessments (VHIT and cVEMP) were insensitive, the occurrence of the symptoms and the benefit of the rehabilitation were clearly shown by MyVRBQ. The content analysis was able to discover other important aspects missed to be covered by the quantitative assessments (including the ability to perform solat before and after the rehabilitation).

(6, 'Farrah Noor Binti Ahmad', 'Mechanical Properties And Bioactivity Of Ti-Nb-Ha Composite Fabricated By Mechanical Alloying', 'Titanium is the most popular metallic biomaterial for orthopaedic implant owing to their excellent mechanical properties and good corrosion resistance. However, the mismatch of elastic modulus and poor bonding with bones due to its bioinert behaviour has been identified as the major reason that lead to the implant loosening and eventual failure of the implantation. The present work investigates the mechanical performances and bioactivity of titanium-niobium-hydroxyapatite (Ti-Nb-HA) composite prepared by mechanical alloying and powder metallurgy. To study effect of HA and Nb , HA and Nb were varied from 0 to 15 wt.% and 0 to 40 wt.%, respectively. The powders of Ti, Nb and HA were mixed in a high energy ball mill for 2 hours at 200 rpm and followed by compaction under 500 MPa and sintering at 1200Â°C. Due to the brittleness of HA, the incorporation of HA decreased the compressive strength (1001.24 MPa to 160.94 MPa) and microhardness (300.53 HV to 85.47 HV). Adding HA contribute to the poor bonding with matrix which is more pronounced to reduce the elastic modulus from 65.10 GPa to 29.91 GPa. With the increasing in HA content, the composite displayed good bioactivity characteristics evaluation in HBSS for 30 days. The highest bioactivity was exhibited by composite with 15 wt.% HA due to the highest apatite (3.40%). Factor affecting the bioactivity are believed to be caused by HA decomposition during sintering process that produces CaO and CaTiO3. As a result, the presence of these Ca2+ ions increased the calcium concentration and accelerated the apatite growth. Higher Nb content improved the compressive strength (199.95 MPa to 300.11 MPa) and microhardness (120.97 HV to 269.90 HV) due to solid solution strengthening. However, the presence of TiO2 and Ti2P decrease compressive strength with 40 wt.% Nb. Apart from that, the elastic modulus was slightly decreased with the rise of Nb content. The highest amount of Î² phase is obtained by 30 wt.% Nb (76%). Increasing in Nb content to 40 wt.% decreases elastic modulus owing to decrement in Î² phase as a consequence of HA decomposition that lead to the formation of TiO2 and Ti2P. The presence of Î² phase, high solubility of Ti2P and functional groups of OH- act as favourable site for apatite growth in composite consisting different amount of Nb. Upon immersion test in HBSS for 30 days, the highest bioactivity was attained by 30 wt.% Nb and followed by 40 wt.% Nb, 20 wt.% Nb, 10 wt.%. The enhanced of apatite growth in 40 wt.% Nb was found to be caused by the presence of biocompatibility phases of TiO2 and Ti2P. Composite with addition of 10 wt.% HA and 30 wt.% Nb displayed the best properties and holds great potential in providing mechanical support and bioactivity enhancement in getting similar cortical bone characteristics.', 'properties bioactivity ti-nb-ha', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering) ', '2020', 0),
(7, 'Suhawati Binti Ibrahim', 'Preparation Of Low Molecular Weight Natural Rubber Via Photooxidation In Latex State', 'Ultraviolet (UV) light has been used to degrade organic matters, including natural rubber (NR) which was commonly carried out in an organic solvent. The aim of this work is to prepare liquid natural rubber (LNR) using a photodegradation method in latex state, hence to characterize its physical and chemical properties. The efficiency of photodegradation was determined by the molecular weight reduction and gel content of the LNR obtained. The molecular structure of LNR was determined by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). While, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to determine the change in morphology of latex particles. Reaction parameters such as UV radiation, temperature, hydrogen peroxide, reaction time, dry rubber content (DRC) and stabilizers showed synergistic effect and influenced the reactionâ€™s efficiency. Anionic surfactant (SDS) provided better stability to NR latex compared to non-ionic surfactant (Teric). The zeta potential of NR latex was increased during the photodegradation, provided by the negatively charge of fatty acid. Phosphate that represent fatty acid amount was increased in latex serum due to the decomposition of phospholipid upon exposure to the UV and oxidizing agent. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) anatase nanocrystals was prepared via the sol-gel method. The dispersed TiO2 in NR latex showed catalytic effect on the photodegradation reaction. The presence of methylene blue as photosensitizer during photodegradation lowered molecular weight of LNR. The cleavage of NR chains during photodegradation occurred at C=CH and CH2-CH2 bonds. The molecular structure of LNRs were similar to that the NR, but hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on its chain increased. These functional groups were formed as a result of chain cleavage of NR. Photodegradation of epoxidized natural rubber (ENR50) latex showed similar reaction to the NR latex without affecting the mole percentage of epoxy group.

However, differences between the compatibility of the hydrophilic clay and the hydrophobic rubber, which would result in a poor dispersion, remains as a challenging problem in industrial applications. This study was conducted to determine the potential of incorporating sepiolite (Sep) as a filler in ethylene propylene diene terpolymer (EPDM). EPDM/Sep composites were prepared with Sep loadings of 0â€“70 parts per hundred of rubber (phr) using a two-roll mill. The results indicated improvements in the tensile and dynamic mechanical properties, swelling resistance and crosslink density, thermal stability, and flammability resistance of the sepiolite-filled composite compared with the unfilled composite. The homogenous dispersion of sepiolite particles in the EPDM matrix and the formation of zigzag structures, especially at 60 phr, were the main reasons for the improved mechanical properties of the composite, which were confirmed by the morphological studies. The formation of a protective layer, which acted as a barrier against heat transfer into the deeper layers, had enhanced the flammability resistance of the composites. In the study of sepiolite hybridised with carbon black (CB), silica, or calcium carbonate (CaCO3), five different compositions were prepared, with EPDM/Sep at 30 phr as a control composite. EPDM/Sep/CB displayed the highest tensile strength, thermal stability, and improved flammability resistance. These results were influenced by the ability of CB to disperse well and form protective layers that could act as a mass transport barrier in the matrix. Significant findings in this work indicated that silica and CB were able to be hybridised with sepiolite, while sepiolite could be a potential substitute for CaCO3 in the EPDM composites. Meanwhile, the utilisation of glut palmitate (GP) salt and (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS) as coupling agents in the EPDM/Sep composites have successfully enhanced the tensile strength and elongation at break, the rubber-filler interaction, and dynamic mechanical properties. The enhanced rubber-filler interaction indicated that the presence of GP and APTMS have improved the compatibility and interaction between Sep and EPDM matrix, as supported by the FTIR results. Studies on different vulcanisation systems revealed that the highest tensile and dynamic mechanical properties were exhibited by the sulphur system, followed by the mixed curative and peroxide system, whereas the highest thermal stability and flammability resistance were demonstrated by the peroxide system.', 'preparation properties sepiolite', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering) ', '2020', 0),

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with the development of diabetes-related cardiovascular complications. This study was divided into two parts: (i) animal study and (ii) human study. This animal study aims to determine the effects of vitamin D deficiency on (a) microvascular endothelial and smooth muscle functions in normal and diabetic rats; (b) the changes to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and oxidative stress parameters in mesenteric arterial tissue of normal and diabetic rats; (c) to study whether oral calcitriol supplementation is able to ameliorate microvascular dysfunction in vitamin D-deficient rats. This human study aims to evaluate the effects of vitamin D deficiency on oxidative stress status in subcutaneous arteries of diabetic patients. Animal study: (a) Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subdivided into three equal groups of 10 rats each: (i) rats receiving 10-weeks of normal diet (Group NC), (ii) rats receiving 10- weeks of vitamin D-deficient diet (Group ND) and (iii) rats receiving 10-weeks of vitamin D-deficient diet with four weeks of oral calcitriol supplementation, starting from week 7 (Groups NDS). (b) Streptozotocin-induced diabetic male SD rats were subdivided into three equal groups of 10 rats each: (i) diabetic rats receiving 10-weeks of normal diet (Group DC), (ii) diabetic rats receiving 10-weeks of vitamin D-deficient diet (Group DD) and (iii) diabetic rats receiving 10-weeks of vitamin D-deficient diet with four weeks of oral calcitriol supplementation, starting from week 7 of diabetes induction (Groups DDS). At the end of 10 weeks, all rats were sacrificed. Ratsâ€™ mesenteric arteries were isolated and dissected to undergo vascular function studies using wire myograph. Protein expression of eNOS in mesenteric arterial tissue was determined using Western blot. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence and localization of eNOS in mesenteric arteries. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in mesenteric arterial tissue; fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels in blood were also measured. Human study: Diabetic patients were categorised into two groups based on serum 25(OH)D levels: (i) vitamin D non-deficient diabetic patients (Group DNP, n = 10) and (ii) vitamin D-deficient diabetic patients (Group DDP, n = 13). The levels of SOD and MDA in subcutaneous arterial tissue were measured. Results of animal study: (a) Normal rats. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh) was significantly attenuated in mesenteric arteries of vitamin D-deficient rats. Reduced SOD levels and protein expression of eNOS were observed in vitamin D-deficient rats. However, calcitriol supplementation showed no significant improvement in these parameters. Endothelium-dependent contraction to calcium ionophore (CaI) was augmented in vitamin D-deficient rats receiving calcitriol supplementation. Increased calcium levels were also found in calcitriol-supplemented vitamin D-deficient rats. (b) Diabetic rats. ACh-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was significantly impaired in mesenteric arteries of vitamin D-deficient diabetic rats. Reduced SOD levels and protein expression of eNOS and enhanced MDA levels were found in vitamin D-deficient diabetic rats. These impairments were successfully ameliorated by calcitriol supplementation. Augmented CaI-induced endothelium-dependent contraction and impaired sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced endotheliumindependent relaxation occurred in vitamin D-deficient diabetic rats. However, calcitriol supplementation failed to show improvement in these vascular responses There were no significant differences in endothelium-independent relaxation to salbutamol (SB) and contraction to phenylephrine (PE) as well as in general parameters such as body weight changes and FBG levels between study groups in both normal and diabetic rats. Results of human study: Markedly augmented MDA levels were found in subcutaneous arterial tissues of vitamin D-deficient diabetic patients. However, SOD levels in vitamin D-deficient diabetic patients showed the reduced trend (p = 0.072) compared to vitamin D non-deficient diabetic patients. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency attenuates microvascular endothelial function in both normal and diabetic rats. The impairment for endothelial function was likely due to the diminished nitric oxide contribution, associated with reduced eNOS protein expression and augmented oxidative stress. Vitamin D deficiency in diabetic rats also impairs vascular smooth muscle function. The study also showed that calcitriol supplementation to diabetic rats with vitamin D deficiency improves endothelium-mediated vasodilation, by upregulating eNOS expression and improving oxidative stress status. However, calcitriol supplementation to normal rats with vitamin D deficiency induces hypercalcaemia, leading to augmented endothelium-dependent contraction. Besides that, vitamin D deficiency in diabetic patients as well showed augmented oxidative stress.', 'vitamin d oxidative diabetics', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Sains Perubatan (School of Medical Sciences)', '2020', 0),

NanoZrO2-SiO2-HA composite was synthesized using a one-pot sol-gel technique, which was then characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). Following the characterization studies, further investigations were carried out after addition of nanoZrO2-SiO2-HA to cGIC (GIC nanoZrO2-SiO2-HA) at varying weight percentage (~3% to 9%) to compare their mechanical properties (compressive strength, flexural strength, and fracture toughness), physical properties (surface roughness, colour stability and sorptionsolubility), chemical property (fluoride ion release) and cytotoxicity in relation to cGIC (Fuji IX). SEM and TEM images were successful in demonstrating that the particle morphology in terms of size to shape distribution was small and narrow with low agglomeration. The nano powder consisted of rod-shaped HA crystallites (~114 nm) interspersed with spherical silica (~18 nm) and zirconia (~39 nm) particles. The FTIR spectra indicated some molecular interaction presented between the nanoZrO2- SiO2-HA and GIC. The XRD diffractogram indicated the presence of peaks for ZrO2, SiO2 and HA. Compressive strength, flexural strength and fracture toughness of GIC 5%nanoZrO2-SiO2-HA was statistically higher than that of other percentages of GIC nanoZrO2-SiO2-HA and cGIC. The highest values recorded were- compressive strength (144.12 ï‚± 13.88 MPa), flexural strength (18.12 ï‚± 2.33 MPa) and fracture toughness (1.35 ï‚± 0.15 MPa.m1/2), leading to an increase of ~30 %, ~26 % and ~57 % respectively, as compared to cGIC. Additionally, GIC 5%nanoZrO2-SiO2-HA had a roughness profile (0.158Î¼m Â± 0.29) similar to cGIC (0.151Î¼m Â± 0.29). Overall, the color change (Î”E) values for GIC 5% nanoZrO2-SiO2-HA group were lower than those of cGIC over a 28 day period and were between slight to perceptible. The GIC 5%nanoZrO2-SiO2-HA showed highly significant difference in the mean fluoride release for all the time intervals as compared to cGIC (p â‰¤ 0.05). In addition, GIC 5%nanoZrO2-SiO2-HA recorded lower sorption values (23.64 Â± 2.3 Î¼gmm-3) as compared to cGIC (36.28 Â± 2.6 Î¼gmm-3) and higher solubility (66.46 Â± 2.4 Î¼gmm-3) as compared to cGIC (56.76 Â± 1.6 Î¼gmm-3). The results of cytotoxicity testing showed that GIC 5%nanoZrO2-SiO2-HA demonstrated cytotoxicity at 24 h incubation for 200 mg/ml conc. However, at 72 h incubation it exhibited lower cytotoxic response as compared to cGIC which was statistically significant (p<0.05) at 200 mg/ml concentration of the material extract. The addition of nanoZrO2-SiO2-HA to cGIC significantly enhanced its physico-mechanical, chemical properties and demonstrated a favourable cytotoxic response.

The powders of Mg, Zn, HAP and Al2O3 were mixed in a high energy ball mill, compacted under 400 MPa and sintered at 300ËšC. The increasing Al2O3 content from 0 to 15 wt. % in the hybrid composite resulted in improvement in hardness (57.60 Hv to 83.87 Hv) and compression strength (126.48 MPa to 244.20 MPa).

Muscovite was chosen over the most commonly used clay minerals, due to its higher aspect ratio when compared to montmorillonite (MMT). As such, this study investigated the possibilities of muscovite to expand and to function as reinforcement filler in ABS matrix via two-stage ion exchange process for fillermatrix compatibilisation and melt compounding for polymer fabrication. The modification process involved treatment with LiNO3 (first-stage) and modification with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) at various concentrations as a secondstage cation exchange reaction. Characterisation of treated muscovite was assessed by using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Brunauerâ€“Emmettâ€“Teller (BET), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) coupled with Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The experimental outcomes showed that not only basal spacing, but also specific surface area increased while the number of stacked individual silicate layers of organoclay kept decreasing at high CTAB concentrations, which signified separation within the muscovite layers. The changes in basal spacing further evidenced that muscovite displayed a possibility for expansion. A further goal of this research is to extend the application of organomuscovite (OM) filled ABS matrix. In this case, OM and unmodified muscovite were embedded in ABS matrix at various filler loading of 1, 3, and 5 wt.%. The aspects addressed included the effect of ion-exchange process, the degree of dispersion that was achieved, and the effect of various filler loading on the mechanical properties of ABS nanocomposites. Along this line, this study reveals that the ABS/OM nanocomposites possessed a tendency to exemplify enhanced mechanical properties, in comparison to those of ABS/muscovite. Nevertheless, incorporation of muscovite at all filler loadings led to a slight reduction in tensile strength, a significant decrease in elongation at break, a slight improvement in modulus and hardness, and increment in thermal stability over those of the neat ABS. Flexural strength and modulus were improved by 10% and 28%, respectively, when compared to those retrieved from neat ABS. Both wide angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD) and TEM analyses indicated the formation of mixed intercalated and exfoliated structures with incorporation of OM. Therefore, the development of non-expandable muscovite incorporated with polymer matrices provide the opportunities to explore new functionalities beyond those found in conventional materials.', 'uscovite/acrylonitrile utadiene styrene', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2020', 0),

This study was the first time conducted whereby three tropical edible seaweeds (Caulerpa species, Gracilaria species, and Padina species) were selected from Western Peninsular Malaysia to investigate their proximate, physicochemical and nutritional properties according to change in season and geographical habitat. Remarkable geographical variability was recorded in the proximate composition of C. racemosa harvested from the pond and wild. Analysis revealed the farm-C. racemosa contain higher concentration of lipids (4.20 Â± 0.32 % DW), protein (20.27 Â± 0.14 % DW), dietary fiber (27.57 Â± 0.14 % DW) and energy values (25.45 Â± 0.07 kcal kgâˆ’1) than the wild-C. racemosa with higher ash level (44.98 Â± 1.60 % DW).

Common bacteria associated with RTIs include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Rapid detection of these pathogens could facilitate towards effective therapies. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and evaluate a thermostabilized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of these six bacteria. The first step involved designing specific primers for the target bacteria and an internal amplification control (IAC). Each set of primers was evaluated to analyze for their specificity and sensitivity. A multiplex PCR was then developed by optimizing the concentration of primers and other components. Initial accuracy of the multiplex PCR was determined on clinical isolates. Subsequently, this assay had undergone lyophilization process in the presence of trehalose as the sugar-stabilizer. The assay stability was tested at different sets of temperature for different time-intervals. In the last stage, this assay was evaluated on the sputum specimens from Hospital USM and further evaluated at the field level using the specimens from Malaysian Hajj pilgrims. Results indicated that all the designed primers were specific to the respective target bacteria. The optimized concentrations of primers for bacteria (0.4 Î¼M) and IAC (0.2 mM), MgCl2 (2.5 mM), dNTPs (0.2 mM) and Taq DNA polymerase enzyme (0.75 unit) were used in the development of multiplex PCR assay. Initial evaluation on bacterial isolates showed that the assay was 100% accurate on both target and non-target bacteria (n =145) (analytical specificity) with the lowest limit of detection was 10 pg DNA (200 bacterial cell) (analytical sensitivity).

One method that can be used to remove dyes is by reduction on a surface of catalyst. The catalyst chosen in this work was silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesised by salt reduction technique. The first part of this thesis focused on the synthesis process of AgNPs. However instead of using typical reductant, AgNPs were synthesised by green chemical route utilising Kyllinga brevifolia extract (KBE) as reducing agent. The KBE was also found to be a good capping as well as stabilizing agent. By controlling the temperature, concentration of AgNO3 as the silver precursor, concentration of KBE and reaction time, the AgNPs were sucsessfully synthesised. The phytochemical constituents in KBE responsible for Ag+ reduction were identified. Carbohydrate, protein, plant sterol (stigmasterol and campesterol) were found to have the highest concentration thus proposed as the main constituents that can reduce Ag+ ions to Ago. KBE derived AgNPs are highly dispersed with ~ 17.64 nm diameter and have quasi-spherical shape. The catalytic removal of MB was then done to demonstrate the properties of AgNPs in removing MB. Four (4) systems were used to investigate the performance of AgNPs; System 1 (AgNPs alone), System 2 (AgNPs + NaBH4), System 3 (AgNPs + KBE) and System 4 (AgNPs on TNTs). From the catalytic study on MB removal, no reduction was observed in System 1. Reduction was the highest in System 2. The pseudo first and second order approaches were used for the kinetic study of System 2. 100% removal efficiency (%RE) was found to be possible in 30 ppm MB solution with pH 8-10 which followed first order kinetic with reaction rate of 2.5715 min-1. For 100 pm solution, the first order kinetic was 1.4614 min-1. It took less than 5 mins for the 100% removal which is considered to be extremely fast. On the other hand, for System 3, 93 %RE of MB was achieved with a rate of reaction of 0.2663 minâˆ’1 at pH 2. The efficient removal is proposed to be due to the process of reduction occuring via electron relay effect whereas in System 3, sedimentation occurred along with the reduction process. However, at the end of the process it was observed that seperation of AgNPs from the treated MB solution was difficult which may pose a secondary pollution. In order to circumvent this, in the second part of this thesis, System 4 was introduced where AgNPs were immobilised on TiO2 before being subjected to be used as catalyst for MB removal. The TiO2 was fabricated on a surface of titanium wire by anodic process. The anodic film was made to be in a form of TiO2 nanotube (TNT) arrays and AgNPs were then dispersed on the TNTs as catalyst support by wet impregnation technique. The TNTs/AgNPs were characterized and their catalytic activity was tested for removal of MB. However, it was found that the removal efficiency was much slower as compared to when AgNPS were used. The reduction of MB by TNTs/AgNPs followed pseudo-first order kinetic with the kinetic rate of 7.5 x 10-3 min-1.', 'silver-nanoparticles kyllinga-brevifolia methyl-blue-dye', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2020', 0);

The experiment deployed eleven children with ASD aged between five to nine years old. Their mental age is between four to five years. A control group with normal children age four to five years was also used for comparison. The physical environment factors being studied are sound decibel, sound frequency, the intensity of the light intensity, type of colour and temperature within the classroom. For the children with ASD, five different levels of each factor were set up for each experiment. Pre-tests (current condition) and post-tests (intervention condition) approach are only applied for sound. The other physical factors were done using typical experimental techniques. Observation method was deployed in all physical factors to study the children with ASD behavioural, emotional and cognitive reaction. Statistical analysis tools are used to quantitatively evaluate the effect of environmental factors on the response time and attention span. Qualitative analysis tools were executed to assess the behavioural, emotional and cognitive reaction. The finding showed that ergonomic intervention caused significant improvement in the speed of understanding and attention span during task performing for the children with ASD compared to their current learning environment.

The optimum voltage and spray time to achieve homogeneous and even CNT coating on the woven CF surface is 15 kV and 15 min, respectively. From single fiber test, the ESD method is found to be safe without any significant degradation on the tensile strength of the woven CF-CNT. The epoxy composite laminates with optimized woven hybrid CF-CNT and woven CF without deposited CNT were then prepared and compared in terms of mechanical, thermal and dielectric properties. The evaluation showed that woven hybrid CF-CNT epoxy composite laminates have greater mechanical, thermal and dielectric properties than woven CF epoxy composite laminates. The results demonstrate that the woven hybrid CF-CNT epoxy composite laminates are capable of improving tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, flexural modulus,interlaminar shear strength, thermal conductivity and dielectric constant about 21 %, 37 %, 19 %, 27 %, 25%, 35 % and 22 %, respectively, compared to the woven CF epoxy composite laminates.', 'fiber carbon nanotube', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2020', 0),

However, this scheme requires high compute platform and memory to support the encryption or decryption process which may not exist in all IoT-attached devices. In order to overcome this issue, this research work proposed an alternative cryptography scheme with improved power-throughput and reduced hardware utilization to be considered as a replacement to the existing AES. Based on the performance analysis among the symmetric cryptography schemes, the AES-128 and Blowfish schemes have been chosen to be enhanced and developed based on Zynq- 7000 field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology by using three design techniques comprised of parallel, pipelined and memory (P2M) techniques. At software level, the findings showed that the proposed Blowfish design had better performance with slices occupied and power consumption decreased by 45.3% and 94% respectively, and double throughput value was generated if compared to the proposed AES-128 design. Despite of these, the proposed AES-128 design increased the throughput by 22% and reduced the power consumed to 56% with 46.8% slices usage compared to the AES designs from previous studies. At hardware level, the proposed Blowfish design continued to be implemented and validated on ZedBoard and Zynq7000 AP SoC ZC702 FPGA platforms operated at 2.4 GHz ZigBee standard via XBee-PRO ZigBee through-hole XBP24CZ7PIT-004 for real-time data transmission. Two FPGA-based radio platforms were used as transmitter and receiver to form a two-way communication and measured in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) indoor environment based on point-to-point (P2P) topology within wireless personal area network (WPAN). The performance results indicated that the proposed P2M Blowfish radio system possessed a good quality in wireless data transmission with the bit-error-rate (BER) of 6.25x10-3, maximum signal strength of -34.58 dBm and maximum communication range of 61 m at 10 dBm transmitter radio frequency (RF) power level.

NP was acquired from the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia. The influence of mix design variables on the properties of NP-based AAC were not been investigated earlier including durability of such a concrete when exposed to aggressive environmental conditions. In order to enable its curing at room temperature conditions and attain desirable properties, nanosilica (nSiO2) was incorporated. The morphology, mineralogy and polymerization mechanism of the developed binder were studied in detail. The fresh and hardened characteristics of nSiO2 modified AAC were investigated including its pore structure. The durability of the AAC when exposed to chloride laden environment, acid and sulfates was also evaluated. The results reveal that the superior properties of NP-based alkali activated binder (AAB) were obtained when 400 kg/m3 of precursor material was activated with a combination of sodium silicate (SS) and sodium hydroxide (SH) at a SS/SH ratio of 2.5 having 14M SH solution cured for 7 days at 60 Â°C. The addition of nSiO2 in the mixture enhanced the strength, morphology and mineralogy of the NP-based AAB when cured at 60 Â°C as well as room temperature conditions. The nature of the binder was composed of C-A-S-H with Na in the structure with greater absorption of Ca and Al in the case of mixes containing 5% and 7.5% nSiO2. The total pore volume of nSiO2 modified concrete after 28 days of room temperature curing was in the range of 18.35% to 11.23%, the highest in the control mix and the lowest in xxviii the AAC mixture prepared with 5% and 7.5% nSiO2 due to enhanced polycondensation of hydration products. As a result of the improved morphology and mineralogy of the AAB modified with nSiO2, durability was remarkably enhanced. The chloride migration coefficient was 12.82, 12.63, 10.52, 7.83 and 6.22 m2/s (x10-12) and the gravimetric weight loss of the reinforcement embedded in the concrete was 1.608, 0.992, 0.793, 0.670 and 0.681% in the AAC modified with 0, 1, 2.5, 5 and 7.5% nSiO2, respectively. The resistance of AAC prepared with 5% and 7.5% nSiO2 exposed to 5% H2SO4 and sulfate solutions was significantly improved than the other replacement levels. Based on the outcomes, it can be concluded that the NP can be utilized to produce structurally viable AAC for practical applications. The inclusion of nSiO2 in the mixture enabled it to be cured at room temperature conditions. Moreover, the performance of the AAC was either comparable to or better than the OPC-based concrete in all aspects studied in this research. Therefore, the use of the developed AAC particularly that cured at room temperature will lead to the benefits including environmental, economic and technical.\r\n\r\n', 'natural-pozzolan alkali nano-silica', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Awam (School of Civil Engineering)', '2020', 0),

Recently, a subset of Tregs expressing tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2+ Tregs) is identified as a more suppressive and proliferative cell population and its regulation is reported to be impaired in respiratory dysfunction condition such as asthma. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a highly potential tool in immunotherapies, are shown to be protective against key features of asthma. Hence, the current study would like to elucidate the effects of AuNPs on the expression of TNFR2+ Tregs, as well as on CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs), which have been shown to induce Tregs in asthmatic individuals and whether a TNFR2 agonist, etanercept, can modulate the effects of AuNPs. A five-color flow cytometry assay was used to determine the expression of cell population of interest in asthmatic and non-asthmatic controls (n=6) and traditional ELISA assay to determine the level of TNF-Î± and IL-10. Stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of asthmatic individuals with AuNPs for 24 hours does not induce significant effects on the cell population of interest. Meanwhile, etanercept as anti-TNF is shown to significantly decrease TNFR2+ Tregs (p = 0.0210) and T effector cells TNFR2+ (Teff) (p = < 0.0001) with an increased pattern of Foxp3+ Tregs only.

Incorporation of SiC particles within zinc matrix as well as dispersion of these particles through the coating thickness are found a practical problem. In order to obtain uniform and dense Zn-SiC composite coating using electrodeposition process, operating parameters should be well controlled. Various operating parameters were used in this study. This includes current density (20, 30, 40 and 50 mA/cm2), stirring speed (300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 rpm) and SiC concentration (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 g/L). The deposition of zinc with SiC particles was performed by electrodeposition process using zinc sulfate bath containing 2 micron sized of SiC particles. The best operating parameters obtained from preliminary study were current density of 40 mA/cm2, stirring speed of 600 rpm and SiC concentration of 20 g/L. To enhance the formation and properties of Zn-SiC composite coating, electrodeposition of Zn-SiC composite coating in presence of niobium chloride and phosphoric acid additives at various concentrations were introduced in this study. The best mechanical and corrosion properties were obtained with 10 g/L of niobium chloride and 7 g/L of phosphoric acid. The higher incorporation rate of SiC particles into zinc matrix was confirmed by SEM and EDS studies. A significant reduction in corrosion parameters of Zn-SiC composite coating was observed in which corrosion potential of -946 mv and -1008 mv were achieved with niobium chloride and phosphoric acid respectively compared with -1100 mv obtained for Zn-SiC composite coating without additives. The microhardness of the composite coating was successfully improved by using the additives during electrodeposition process. Microhardness value of 312 Hv and 252 Hv were obtained at 10 g/L of niobium chloride and 7 g/L of phosphoric acid respectively whereas it was reached to 166 Hv without additives. The change in the microstructure of Zn-SiC composite coating to fine grains was also noted. The morphology of the coating, mechanical properties and corrosion behavior of the Zn-SiC composite coating were further improved in the presence of niobium chloride and phosphoric acid additives. The presence of additives in the bath solution led to an increase in zeta potential and change the surface charge of SiC particles to more positive which results in more particles acquired to the cathode surface. Hence, the particles were more stable in the solution due to electrostatic repulsion which preventing agglomeration of these particles and consequently increase the incorporation rate of SiC in the coating.', 'additives zinc-silicon electrodeposotion', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2019', 0),

The wireless telecommunication is all about the radiation of electromagnetic waves, and the optical waveguide transmits signals at the speed of light. The aspiration of this work is to introduce the vertex-based residual distribution(RD) schemes for Maxwellâ€™s equations, which is time-explicit and still secondorder-accurate. The computational electromagnetics (CEM) works do not havea standard mesh topology for unstructured grid, which might inhibit their computationaldevelopment. The most eminent residual distribution scheme which vouches for the second-order-accuracy is the Lax-Wendroff residual distribution (RD-LW) scheme. The RD schemes are transcendent for upwind schemes that stay compact, such as the RD-LDA (low diffusion A) scheme, but appears to be time-implicit for time-dependent fluid problems. The first innovation in this work is to procure a time-explicit updating scheme for RD-LDA scheme while still retaining the order-of-accuracy. Besides, the RD-Galerkin method is propounded in this work, which is rare in RD framework. Secondly, the weak Galerkin FEM is adapted for time-dependent second-order Maxwellâ€™s equation, and also devising a gradient flux residual approach which is tantamount to the RD-scheme for secondorder Maxwellâ€™s equation. These two effective solvers reduce first-order Maxwellâ€™s equations to second-order Maxwellâ€™s equation in scalar form. The weak Galerkin finite-element method (FEM) is indisputably more accurate in replicating nuxxiv merical results, but it is somehow deficient upon handling certain boundaries,unlike the gradient flux residual approach. The novelty of this work comes from introducing the RD schemes to first-order Maxwellâ€™s equations, while devising a new RD scheme for the second-order Maxwellâ€™s equation. The test cases in this work comprised of three main electrodynamics phenomena, they are waveguide propagation, radiation mechanism and scattering problem. Three-dimensional problems are also studied to ascertain the extension of these schemes for realtime applications. The numerical results manifest no instability issues for all the constructed numerical schemes. The lumped RD-LDA scheme trims off the computational cost by approximately 50 times, as compared to its time-implicit consistent mass-matrix approach, although this is still 4 to 6 times higher than the RD-LW schemeâ€™s. In general, the space-centered schemes of RD-LW, RDGalerkin, weak Galerkin FEM and gradient flux residual in this work promise an order-of-accuracy between 1:4212 and 2:43871.

However, the static responses of fibre at different aspect ratios incorporated with crumb rubber aggregate in a double layer are yet to be investigated. This study investigates the effect of crumb rubber aggregates with and without steel fibres on the flexural behaviour of layered and non-layered reinforcement concrete beams on a full scale. Rubberized concrete of layered and non-layered specimens were prepared by partial replacement of 10%, 12.5%, and 15% of sand aggregate volumes. Fibrous concrete were prepared from different types of aspect ratios of steel fibres (80 and 60) with different lengths for hooked-end and micro copper coated steel fibres at a 0.5% of the volume fractions. The layered specimens were constructed by placing rubberized concrete at the top and both layers, whilst the bottoms were dedicated to fibrous concrete. The non-layered specimens were prepared using a combination of rubberized and fibrous concrete subjected to their aspect ratios. The static responses were evaluated in terms of their fresh properties and beam characteristicsâ€™ behaviour. The findings revealed that the layering enhanced the mechanical propertiesâ€™ performances compared to the non-layered samples. Increasing the aspect ratios of the steel fibres with inclusion of the crumb rubber aggregate led to increase in flexural strength and stiffness of the beams, whilst the lower aspect increases the toughness, ultimate deflection, ductility index and strain. Furthermore, the newly developed layered beams helped for further cracking control and enhanced the failure patterns.

In addition, their ionic dissolution products such as Ca2+, Mg2+, silicate (Si4+) have been reported to positively affect the bone cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. However, the low fracture toughness and fracture strength of akermanite limit its biomedical applications, particularly under load-bearing sites. The purpose of this study is to dope strontium (Sr2+) and cobalt (Co2+) into akermanite ceramic to improve their mechanical properties (particularly fracture toughness). This is performed by high energy planetary ball milling of oxide powders of Ca, Mg and Si with Sr and Co (as dopant) for 3 h with speed of 500 rpm. This is followed by sintering in the furnace at 1200Â°C for 4 h temperature. Sr is bone seeker trace elements which possess positive effects on bone formation (osteogenesis). The Sr concentration of 5, 10 and 15 mol% was chosen in this study. On the other hand, low concentration of Co has effects on vascularization (angiogenesis) and the concentration of 2 mol% and 5 mol% was chosen for Co doping accordingly. In ion doping, the dopant could either partially or fully doped in the host ceramic. Since, partial substitution occurs in in real experimental conditions, the ratio of Sr/Sr+Ca and Co/Co+Mg was chosen. Accordingly, the compositions were categorized as 0.05Sr, 0.10Sr and 0.15Sr based on the Sr/Sr+Ca and 0.02Co and 0.05Co based on Co/Co+Mg ratio. The results obtained confirmed that Sr2+ and Co2+ substitution did not change the silicate structure and akermanite phase. In addition, the Sr2+ and Co2+ substitution enhanced physical and mechanical properties of akermanite. However, the toughness and strength of akermanite were dependent on the Sr2+ (5 mol% optimum) and Co2+ (2 mol% optimum) content. The optimum fracture strength and toughness of Sr-substituted sample was found to be 16.44 and 1.42 MPa.m1/2, respectively. On the other hand, the optimum strength and toughness of Co-substituted sample was 21.35 MPa and 1.68 MPa.m1/2, respectively indicating that Co improves the mechanical properties of akermanite. In vitro bioactivity and biodegradability revealed different apatite morphology depending on the Sr2+ content after 21 days of soaking in SBF solution and controlled the biodegradability of akermanite. Compared to Sr-doped akermanite sample, the Co-doped sample did not show obvious apatite formation and biodegradability after 21 days of soaking in SBF solution compared to pure akermanite. However, the pH value of SBF media showed a higher pH value compared to akermanite possibly due to faster release of Ca2+ into the media. Finally, both akermanite and Sr-substituted akermanite samples showed cytocompatibility while Sr-containing sample showed higher human fetal osteoblast (hFOB) cell viability which demonstrated the positive effect of Sr2+ ions on the hFOB cell proliferation.

In wind engineering the wind hazard assessment are evaluated based on the value of wind speed. Currently the value of wind speed is referred to basic wind speed (Vs). Basic wind speed is defined as the probability of the maximum wind speed within the return period. However, wind speed at specific location which is known as site wind speed (Vsite) should consider the effect of land use land cover and topography effect. Apart from that, wind hazard assessment on a spatial area is not feasible because of the Vsite value determined based on the point location. Therefore, the main objective of this study to develop the site specific wind hazard map by using geo-spatial technique. In MS 1553:2002 Vsite is calculated by multiplying the Vs with the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) factor denoted as Mz,cat, and topographic factor as Mh. In order to apply these formulae in a spatial area, Geographical Information System is used. This study also examined the wind hazard assessment by compare the performance of Vs map and Vsite map produced. For that reason, the past windstorm damage in Peninsular Malaysia is used to validate the performance of the wind hazard map produced. From the result, wind hazard map based on the site specific wind speed (Vsite) is highly recommended compared to the basic wind speed (Vs) map. The result showed that the damage occurred at lower Vs value compared to Vsite. Based on 50 years return period for windstorm damage cases, Vs is identified at 31.66 m/s which is 9.02% lesser when compared to value identified using Vsite which is equal to 34.80 m/s. It can be concluded that the risk assessment by referring only to Vs are misleading.

Thus, in this study, thermoplastic elastomer composites based on ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), natural rubber (NR) and mengkuang leaf fibre (MLF) were developed. Firstly, the best blending sequences was studied to produce composites with the best end properties. The EVA:NR ratio was fixed at 50:50 while the MLF loadings were varied from 0 to 10 phr. It was found that better enhancement in the end properties were achieved when EVA was blended with NR first before the addition of MLF. This system produces the composites with the best fiber dispersion in the matrix, resulting in low stabilization torque, good tensile properties, and better thermal stability, compared with the other systems. Secondly, fiber modification through alkaline peroxide bleaching treatments were examined. The treatment was found to be effective in removing surface impurities, lignin and hemicellulose, thereby producing a rougher fibre surfaces which promote a good fibre/matrix adhesion, as depicted by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), thus resulting better tensile properties and thermal properties. Furthermore, the treatment were resulted in the reduction of water absorption from 31% to 26%. Next, comparison between EVA/NR/MLF and EVA/(epoxidized natural rubber) ENRxxvi 50/MLF composites were evaluated. It was found that, the EVA/ENR-50/MLF composites showed lower stabilization toque, higher tensile and thermal properties than EVA/NR/MLF composites. These results indicated that the EVA/ENR-50/MLF composites had better compatibility than the EVA/NR/MLF composites. This result was probably due the interaction between the carbonyl group of the EVA and the epoxy group of the ENR-50 and the formation of hydrogen bonds between the MLF and the EVA/ENR-50 matrix. However, the presence of ENR-50 had further increased the water absorption of the blend and composites due to oxirane group present in the ENR-50. Lastly, the influenced of different types of vulanisation system namely sulfur and peroxide curing systems were evaluated. The stabilization torque of vulcanized composites exhibited higher value compared to its unvulcanized counterparts as the effect of the crosslinking. Dicumyl peroxide (DCP) cure system showed higher improvement in tensile strength and modulus compared to sulfur vulcanizates. However, sulfur cure system showed better resistance towards thermal degradation compared to peroxide system.

Both problems need to be considered when optimizing the LDPE production to ensure the highest profit and a safe operation can be achieved. However, this is not an easy task since the conversion of the monomer (XM), which is normally proportional to high profits, could be achieved at high reaction temperatures and could lead to a high fouling formation. Consequently, in this work, the dynamic optimization study to obtain the optimum production of the LDPE under thermal safety and fouling resistance constraints is carried out. Prior to the dynamic optimization study, the kinetic rate parameters estimation is carried out. A mathematical model is developed and validated using industrial data. For thermal safety considerations, a suitable form of energy balance is developed and the reactor critical temperature ( ) is determined. For the fouling study, fouling resistance (Rf) is used as the fouling measurement. This study uses the changes in the heat transfer coefficient (U) determined from industrial data in order to obtain the maximum reactor fouling resistance. Based on the sensitivity studies, monomer flow rate (FM), initiator flow rate (FI), solvent flow rate (FS) and reactor inlet pressure (Pin) are selected as the optimized parameter variables while reactor jacket temperature (TJ) is selected as the optimized control variable in the dynamic optimization. In the dynamic optimization study, the optimization problems are solved using dynopt coded programming which is based on orthogonal collocation (OC) and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods. In different constraints case studies, the results show that the optimization case without thermal safety and fouling resistance constraints gives a higher XM than the optimization case with and constraints. Five different objective functions (OF) are considered to identify the most optimum reactor performance. The thermal safety and fouling resistance constraints are considered and are successfully satisfied in all the cases. The highest of 365.99 â„ƒ and of 49.48 cm2. s.K /cal are obtained by maximum XM and maximum profit OFs, respectively.

Despite this, Anammox system has long start-up period and the Anammox bacteria can easily undergo inhibition or starvation due to fluctuation of feed in wastewater treatment plants. In the first part of the study, Anammox bacteria were enriched in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with a working volume of 8L. In 75 weeks the substrates were increased step wise from 100 â€“ 900 mg-N/L. The substrates provided (ammonium + nitrite) were in equimolar balance of 1:1. The parent SBR achieved more than 90% of nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) in 14 weeks. The second part of the study was to investigate the effect of external hydrazine addition on aiding the start-up of Anammox reactor. Effects of 5 different externally added hydrazine concentration on reactor start-up were studied (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 mg/L). According to the results obtained, SBR with 10 mg/L hydrazine addition only took 7 weeks with an NRE of 86%. However, the SBR with no hydrazine addition took 11 weeks to stabilize with a NRE of 83.5%. The third part of the study was done to evaluate the effect of substrate inhibition on Anammox bacteria and ability of external hydrazine addition to aid the recovery of Anammox bacteria. 3 substrate concentrations were studied which were 900, 1100 and 1300 mg-N/L. The outcomes show that the inhibition percentage (IP%) obtained for reactors with substrate concentration of 900, 1100 and 1300 mg-N/L after 28 days of inhibition were 27, 38 and 75%, respectively. It was found that the substrate inhibition model (Edwards model) is the best model to represent the inhibition towards Anammox bacteria. Half saturation constant (Ks) and inhibition constant (KIE) obtained were 361.62 mg/L and 731.3 mg/L, respectively. During the recovery studies, reactors that had hydrazine addition showed better recovering capabilities compared to the one without hydrazine addition. The best result in terms of NRE was obtained from the reactor inhibited with 900 mg-N/L and recovered in the presence of hydrazine (R9H) which was 94%. Evidently, the best growth rate was also obtained from reactor R9H at 0.22/day and the lowest growth rate was obtained for R13 which was 0.07/day. The final part of this study was to evaluate the effect of different starvation condition on Anammox bacteria and its recovery. Three different starvation were studied which were starvation with the presence of ammonium (Ra), nitrite (Rn), and hydrazine (Rh). The decay rates calculated after 15 days for Ra, Rn, and Rh were 0.032/day, 0.042/day and 0.019/day, respectively. Finally, the best and the worst recovering capabilities after starvation were shown by reactor Rh and Rn where the growth rate value tabulated were 0.092/day and 0.011/day, respectively.', 'anaerobic ammonium oxidation', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Kimia (School of Chemical Engineering)', '2019', 0);

However, poor dispersion and incompatibility of kenaf in NRLF still remain as challenging issue for their practical application in various environment. In this research kenaf filled NRLF composite containing 0 to 7 part per hundred rubbers (phr) of kenaf loading was prepared through a well-known Dunlop processing method. Kenaf filled NRLF shows reduction of tensile properties, swelling resistance and thermal stability properties of kenaf filled NRLF composites as compared to the unfilled NRLF. The less physical interaction via penetration and/or interlocking of NRLF chains at kenaf surface contributed to weak interfacial adhesion between kenaf and NRLF which leads to the decreased in properties of kenaf filled NRLF composites. However, with some modification to the kenaf and NRLF, the properties of kenaf filled NRLF were improved. Studies on the partial replacement of kenaf by starch were carried out to determine the potential of starch as replacement for kenaf in NRLF composites. Series of five composites of kenaf/starch filled NRLF composites with different kenaf/starch fraction loading (i.e. 7/0, 5/2, 3.5/3.5, 2/5 and 0/7 phr) were prepared. Partial replacement of kenaf by starch produced hybrid filler composites showed great potential as co-filler with kenaf NRLF composites, at which the tensile properties, swelling resistance, compression and hardness was improved with increased in starch fraction. The thermal stability was higher at 3.5/3.5 kenaf/starch fraction. Based on this series of studies, the corn starch was then used as a co-filler in the formulation of kenaf filled NRLF with fix amount of starch (3 phr). The results show that the tensile strength, elongation at break, swelling resistance, hardness, thermal stability and density were higher compared with samples without corn starch. The morphological study by SEM shows that samples with co-filler have smaller pores size and better distribution. The effect of treated kenaf by alkaline treatment on the properties of kenaf filled NRLF composites were then studied separately. The dispersion of kenaf in NRLF and interfacial adhesion between kenaf and NRLF was further enhanced with the addition of treated kenaf, which enhanced tensile properties, hardness, compression, thermal stability and swelling resistance of the kenaf filled NRLF composites. The used of prevulcanized NRL shows the improvement of several properties of kenaf filled NRLF. The results show that 24 hours was the optimum time for prevulcanization of NRL. By comparing with samples without prevulcanized, samples with prevulcanized NRLF shows higher tensile properties, swelling resistance, density, hardness and thermal stability due to the crosslink density effects.

Despite the fact that EGX is a promising active emerging stock market, the background of EGX illustrated by Niemczak & Smith (2013) shows that EGX is not only inefficient but also fragile and exposed to crisis. Therefore, it is expected that some investors are more informed and it is worth to investigate such case in light of the two recent crises particularly the political turmoil. Using behavioral finance aspects, this research aims to identify the trading patterns (e.g. momentum, contrarian) and performance of buy and sell trades conducted by different types of investors (i.e., domestic individuals, domestic institutions, foreign individuals, and foreign institutions) during crisis and non-crisis periods. The dataset of investorsâ€™ daily inflows and outflows is extended from January 2006 to December 2016. The Vector Autoregressive (VAR) is employed to detect feedback trading, and volatility (e.g. via Wald test), while the method of Kamesaka et al.

The results indicate that the trading strategies utilized by the four investor categories during crisis periods differ from those employed during non-crisis periods. Second, momentum and contrarian patterns are heavily employed but in different intense. Further, Institutional foreigners were winners during the five sub-periods while Individual investors were nearly always losers.

These methods include the combination of the Sumudu transform (ST) with the homotopy perturbation method (HPM), namely the Sumudu transform homotopy perturbation method (STHPM), the combination of the ST with the variational iteration method (VIM), namely the Sumudu transform variational iteration method (STVIM) and finally, the combination of the ST with the homotopy analysis method (HAM), namely the Sumudu transform homotopy analysis method (STHAM). Although these standard methods have been successfully used in solving various types of differential equations, they still suffer from the weakness in choosing the initial guess. In addition, they require an infinite number of iterations which negatively affect the accuracy and convergence of the solutions. The main objective of this thesis is to modify, apply and analyze these methods to handle the difficulties and drawbacks and find the analytical approximate solutions for some cases of linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These cases include second-order two-point boundary value problems (BVPs), singular and systems of second-order two-point BVPs. For the proposed methods, the trial function was employed as an initial approximation to provide more accurate approximate solutions for the considered problems. In addition, for the STVIM method, a new algorithm has been proposed to solve various kinds of linear and nonlinear second-order two-point BVPs.

Flat sheet membranes consist of mixed polymer cellulose acetate (CA) and chitosan (CS) was acts as the sensing platform for chromophore binding. Membrane with 17 wt.% CA and 1 wt.% CS showed to have the high binding capacity and high binding stability up to 90 days of measurement. The addition of deionized water (DI) as the non-solvent additive has also shown to improve the membrane porousness, which improved the sensorâ€™s sensitivity. Visible color changes of the colorimetric membrane from blue-greenish to peachy-pink was observed when it was in contact with the Pb2+ ions in 1 ppm Pb(NO3)2. Selection of sensitive chromophore (Dithizone, 1-(2-pyridylazo) 2-naphthol and 4-(2-pyridylazo)-resorcinol) and its immobilization strategy on the membrane sensor has also been carried out. Dithizone (DTz) at unadjusted pH was capable to produce an obvious color transition observed through UV-visible absorption spectrum and naked eyes recognition. The optimum immobilization of DTz required the concentration of 100 ppm and 10 minutes immobilization time. To determine the sensitivity and selectivity of the developed colorimetric sensor in the single and mixed aqueous heavy metals ions solution, the sensing conditions such as pH, type of heavy metals (Pb2+, Hg2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+), concentration and response time were evaluated. The developed DTz-membrane sensor in this work has exhibited quick (within 1 minute) color change and was able to display distinctive color changes from blue-greenish to peachy-pink, yellowish-orange, red-violet and reddish-brown in the response to the presence of Pb2+, Hg2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+ in aqueous solutions. The quantitative analysis using RGB (R:Red; G:Green; B:Blue) data showed that each tested metal ions have demonstrated their own RGBâ€™s recognition pattern phase without significant interfering effects among the heavy metal ions.

The preparation of composite hydrogels with both thermo- and magneto-responsiveness requires careful layer-by-layer coatings of functional shells onto the core of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). However, multiple stages of shell encapsulation of MNPs remains a major setback on the production of composite hydrogels with adequate colloidal stability and well-functioned dual-responsiveness. In this study, homo-polymeric poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-encapsulated magnetite nanoparticles (PNIPAM-MNPs) cross-linked composite hydrogels were facilely synthesized via layer-by-layer coatings with and without employing silanization precursor, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (MPS).

In the temperature manipulated adsorption-desorption tests, desorption of Cr3+ gradually predominated as temperature increased from 298 K to 323 K for PNIPAMsilica-PVP-MNPs. Re-adsorption of Cr3+ by the composite hydrogel took place as being quenched to 298 K for lower initial Cr3+ concentration (20 â€“ 80 mg L-1) which showed that desorption can be realised for surface adsorption. Before heating, the equilibrium adsorption data of Cr3+ fitted well into Flory-Huggins and Frumkin models, that elucidated the chelation of Cr3+ ions occurred via replacement of water molecules on the binding sites.

Among the CO2 removal techniques, membrane gas absorption (MGA) can be used to separate CO2 at low pressure. MGA integrates the advantages of membrane and chemical absorption process in a single unit. However, membrane wetting in the long operation can induce the increment of mass transfer resistance even using hydrophobic membranes. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is the commonly used membrane in MGA, but PVDF defluorination in amine solutions was postulated to cause membrane wetting. In this research, poly[2,2â€™-(m-phenylene)-5,5â€™-dibenzimidazole (PBI) with the great chemical resistance and thermal stability was blended into PVDF membrane to enhance the physical and chemical properties membrane. Besides that, SAPO-34 zeolite with CO2 absorption affinity was incorporated into PVDF membrane to improve CO2 absorption. PVDF membrane incorporated with SAPO-34 zeolite was hydrophobically modified using silane. Hydrogen bonding in the polymer blend due to donor (-NH-) and proton acceptor (-N=) of PBI encouraged the formation of miscibility blend. PVDF/PBI membrane with 20 wt% of PBI showed the highest CO2 flux of 3.07 x 10-4 mol/m2s. The CO2 flux of PVDF membrane increased 60 % to 4.53 x 10-4 mol/m2s when it was blended with 10 wt% of SAPO-34 zeolite. The pre-modified SAPO-34 zeolite using fluorocarbon silane retarded the formation of porous structure, resulting in a great membrane resistance for CO2 transfer. The post-modification of PVDF/SAPO-34 membrane using silane caused improvement in CO2 absorption. The significant improvement of water contact angle and liquid entry pressure resulted in the increment of overall mass transfer coefficient (Ko) to 12.46 x 10-6 m/s. Introducing humid CO2 gas into MGA system incorporated with the post-modified PVDF/SAPO-34, the CO2 permeation was significantly reduced to 10.65 x 10-6 m/s. The Ko of post-modified membrane remained similar to the overall mass transfer coefficient of non-silanated PVDF/SAPO-34 membrane. The wetting study conducting in diethanolamine (DEA) solution (2 M) showed that incorporation of zeolite reduced swelling of that PVDF/SAPO-34 membrane. However, the unfavorable interaction between fluoroalkyl and amine groups induced severe wetting of post-modified PVDF/SAPO-34 membrane by amine. Hence, PVDF/SAPO-34 hollow fiber with different SAPO-34 loadings (1, 3 and 5 wt%) were synthesized. The highest CO2 flux of 8.73 x 10-4 mol/m2s was achieved when 3 wt% of SAPO-34 zeolite was incorporated into PVDF/SAPO-34 hollow fiber. PVDF/SAPO-34 hollow fiber exhibited lower mass transfer resistance in comparison to PVDF/SAPO-34 flat sheet. The CO2 absorption flux of PVDF/SAPO-34 membrane was greatly improved of about 140 % higher than the CO2 absorption flux of the neat membrane when 2 M DEA was used as the liquid absorbent. Neat hollow fiber membrane swelled nearly 71.0 % after being wetted by amine.

Many publishers of GRs focus on strong plots using reduced language code to achieve this objective; however, there are stakeholders who recognise the importance of retaining good natural literary discourse. Rosenblatt\'s transactional reader response theory and Miall and Kuiken\'s foregrounding theory support the notion that stylistic devices have the capacity to create evocation in the reader which could heighten the aesthetic or pleasurable reading experience. Taking this into consideration, the study examined the effect of literariness in GRs for them to be considered good by investigating the extent of employment of selected stylistic devices in GRs that are considered good (awardwinning GRs) and that are considered less good (non-award winning GRs) to determine the importance of literariness in making successful GRs.

However, most studies have focused on the overall effect of CPTED on house break-ins. They have overlooked the individual effects of the natural & mechanical indicators & dimensions of CPTED. Therefore, more comprehensive research is required to explore the effect of natural CPTED versus mechanical CPTED.

(74, 'Koh Chin Kok', 'Modified Statistical Process Control For Short Runs Test And Measurement Process To Reduce False Alarm', ' The key characteristics of test and measurement (T&M) manufacturing are short production runs, multi-product families and testing at multi-stations. Classical Shewhart control charts, namely xÌ„ chart and R chart have been widely used in statistical process control (SPC). Short production runs in T&M render these charts inefficacious as inherent meager data do not warrant meaningful control limits. Measurement errors increase the risks of false acceptance and rejection, thereby leading to consequences such as unnecessary process adjustment and loss of confidence in SPC. Industry practice allows the installation of Guard band, e.g., through Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) to reduce the width of acceptance limit, as an indirect way to compensate the measurement errors. Past related works which presented standardized observations technique is highly recommended due to its simplicity and practicality. However, the concern is that this technique requires sufficient data to calculate the control limits and it does not deal with the effect of measurement errors. Based on this premise, the research objective is to develop a modified SPC model by considering measurement uncertainty in modified control charts (Z chart and W chart) for short runs T&M process in multi-stations. The implementation of this model involves two phases. Phase I retrospective analysis computes the input parameters, such as the standard deviation of the measurement uncertainty, measurement target and estimate of the population standard deviation. Thereafter, Five-band setting and Sâ€“factor are proposed to estimate process standard deviation to maximize the the opportunity to detect assignable causes with low false-reject rate. Lastly, the modified Z chart and W chart are generated in Phase II using standardized observations technique that considers the measurement target and the estimated process standard deviations. Run tests based on Nelsonâ€™s rules to interpret the control charts. In terms of validation, three case studies, labeled as Case I, Case II and Case III were conducted with different ratios of standard deviations in measurement uncertainty and population to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. A complete yearâ€™s data samples were collected from products tested at multi-stations in a T&M manufacturing facility at Bayan Lepas, Penang. For Case I with the measurement error is negligible and does not affect the process standard deviation; the results indicate that there were no false alarm points found in all methods. In Case II with the measurement error may noticeably affect the process standard deviation, and the results show that the model with Five-band setting and S-factor reduced the false alarm rate by 100% in comparison to the classical Shewhart method, except for the Five-band setting which has a smaller sustained shift (25% false alarm) was falsely detected in station WH05. In Case III with the measurement error is relatively larger and appeared to be more significantly affecting the process standard deviation; the results reveal that both proposed methods performed well in modified Z and W charts, which reduced false alarm rate by 50% for station WH05, 0% for station WH06 and 37.5% for station WH07. As a conclusion, the research has proposed and demonstrated the modified SPC model can address the understudied issues caused by short production runs and measurement errors. The model is practical for T&M manufacturing to reduce false alarms and to prevent unnecessary process adjustment.', 'control measurement false-alarm', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Awam (School of Civil Engineering)', '2018', 0),

In WSN, sensor nodes are deployed on the target area to sense the required events. The deployment of nodes can be formal (in specific locations) or random (in random locations). In the WSN that uses the random deployment of nodes, one of the common problems, when the sensors are close to each other, is the overlapping between them. This overlapping causes sensing approximately the same data by different nodes and also the transmission of duplicate data to the Cluster Head (CH), which leads to more energy consumption. Another problem in WSNs is the direct transmission of data from a CH to the Base Station (BS), which also negatively influences the overall network lifetime. Moreover, the random selection of the CHs leads to select nodes with low energy to be CHs which reduces the network lifetime. This thesis intends to solve the overlapping between nodes and the direct data transmission using different mechanisms. In this thesis, a mechanism is proposed to prolong the network lifetime by reducing the negative effect of the overlapping problem and utilizing the overlapping nodes to maximize the efficiency of the network in terms of network lifetime and energy consumption. This mechanism considers the distance between nodes in an efficient way in order to identify the overlapping between them based on the nature of the application with considering the blind area of the overlapping nodes.\r\n\r\n', 'wireless overlapping transmission', '', 'Institut Penyelidikan Pendidikan Tinggi Negara IPPTN (National Higher Education Research Institute NaHERI)', '2018', 0),

However, local spatial variation process in rainfall due to vegetation and topography is unidentified when using a global model. This study aims to assess the local spatial variation of rainfall in the relationships between rainfall, vegetation and elevation using a local modelling approach. The main data used consist of rainfall depths, vegetation index of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images and the elevation data from 174 and 103 locations of rainfall stations within the Northern and East Coast Region of Peninsular Malaysia respectively. Based on the availability of NDVI datasets from the years 2000, 2009 and 2011, the local spatial variations of rainfall were determined. The small clustering patterns in rainfall, vegetation and elevation that were computed in Moran\'s Index with the value of 0.1 to 0.5 showed low values of the variables being clustered in the study areas. Thus, the spatial process in rainfall, vegetation and elevation demonstrated a potential for local variations. The spatial pattern of these variables led to the exploration of non-stationary relationships. In order to explore the local spatial variation of rainfall, the regression techniques of Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) were applied to determine three types of models i.e. : (1) the relationship between rainfall and vegetation; (2) the relationship between rainfall and elevation; and (3) the relationship between rainfall, vegetation and elevation. The statistical findings for all relationships had shown significant local variations when Akaike\'s Information Criterion (AICc) obtained from GWR were lower.

Recently, researchers have shown an interest in solving the issue of non-uniform illumination. However, most of these techniques divide the image into two parts only namely over-exposed and under-exposed regions and try to enhance the poor contrast in both regions using same approach. However, these methods are not robust and they are specifically designed to solve a specific problem at one time. This limitation has motivated this study to propose a new technique to solve the abovementioned problems. In the beginning, Adaptive Local Exposure Based Region Determination (ALEBRD) method is proposed to determine and divide the image into three regions namely under-exposed, over-exposed, and well-exposed regions. The results show that the proposed ALEBRD method produced better region determination performance than the other state-of-the-art methods. Based on the qualitative analysis, it could determine those three regions with high accuracy. After that, contrast of each region will be enhanced using a new local contrast enhancement technique called Adaptive Fuzzy Exposure Local Contrast Enhancement (AFELCE). The proposed AFELCE method is specifically designed to enhance the contrast of each region using different approaches. The proposed AFELCE technique successfully improves the contrast of 300 low-contrast and non-uniform illumination images, taken from three different databases namely standard, underwater, and microscopic human sperm images. The proposed AFELCE method qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods,. Qualitatively, the proposed AFELCE method has successfully enhanced the contrast of those images by producing more uniform illumination images with high contrast. Quantitatively, the proposed AFELCE method produces the highest average of Entropy (E), Measure of Enhancement (EME) and Universal Image Quality Index (UIQI) for the standard image database with values of 7.582, 42.75 and 0.94 respectively.

The effects of reduction/nitridation temperature, time, atmosphere and addition of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into coal on the formation of TiOxCyNz and iron (Fe) from ilmenite were investigated in carbothermal reduction and nitridation (CTRN) process at 1100-1250 Â°C for 60-180 minutes with four different PET-to-coal ratios (C/Ored) ranging from 25 to 100 wt%. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) analyses showed that the product synthesized by 75 wt% PET had a unique microstructure in which spherical Fe particles were distinctly separated from TiO0.02C0.13N0.85 phase. The highest extents of reduction and nitridation of the sample synthesized by 75 wt% PET were 99.15% and 85.47%, respectively. Iron was also removed by an aeration leaching process at 70 Â°C in the presence of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and 0.1 wt% AQ-2 (Anthraquinone-2- sulfonic acid sodium salt monohydrate) as the effective catalysts. The efficiency of Fe removal was 98.5%, and final TiO0.02C0.13N0.85 contained 0.48 wt% Fe as determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis. The chlorination mechanism of titanium nitride (TiN) and TiOxCyNz were extensively investigated at 250 Â°C - 400 Â°C. The extent of chlorination moderately increased with increasing the temperature and decreasing particle size of TiN at constant flow rate of N2-Cl2 gas mixture. The highest extents of chlorination of TiN at 250 Â°C and 400 Â°C were about 85.6% and 97.7% in 60 minutes, respectively. The results also indicated that a shrinking core model with mixed-control mechanism governed the chlorination rate. The surface chemical reaction of chlorine gas on the surface of TiN particles was rate controlling in the initial stage and, during later stage, internal (pore) diffusion through the intermediate product layer was rate controlling step. The apparent activation energy (Ea) of about 10.97 kJ/mole was obtained for the chlorination of TiN. The extent of chlorination of TiO0.02C0.13N0.85 was 93.5% at 400 Â°C in 60 minutes. The TiCl4 with the purity of about 99% was eventually produced from ilmenite and the residue of the chlorination contained high amounts of rear earth elements (REEs) as well as refractory metals.

(107, ' Nurhanim Binti Abdul Aziz', 'Removal Of Sulphate In Waste Recycle Aggregate Using Bacillus Subtilis', 'Waste concrete aggregate (WCA) is highly potential to be re-utilised as a recycled material as it is applicable to numerous functions. Attached cement paste on WCA surface has limited the potential WCA to be recycled as a part of raw construction materials. Low density, high in water absorption and sulphate content are identified as the major contributing factors for this limitation. The sulphate content in delayed ettringite formation (DEF) from high water absorption of attached cement paste leads to DEF expansion and forms a micro-crack, causing a mass loss and affects the mechanical strength (compressive strength) of the concrete. The main objective of the present study was to treat WCA by incorporating the use of Bacillus subtilis before it was reused in recycled cement mortar (RCM) production. The characteristics of WCA were previously identified prior to the B. subtilis adhesion test. The efficiency of B. subtilis to treat WCA was evaluated based on four variable factors i.e. B. subtilis concentration, B. subtilis: WCA ratio, zeta potential, and retention time. Treated WCA (TWCA) from the WCA treatment by B. subtilis was reused as a part of RCM production. The compressive strength of RCM was subsequently evaluated to determine its quality. Results revealed that WCA had a low density, high water absorption, carbonated by attached cement paste and rich in ettringite. WCA contained 0.53 Â±0.06 % of soluble sulphate and 47.76 Â±8.43 % of attached cement paste. Leaching behaviour of inorganic element demonstrated Ca and SO42- as major elements, ranging from 10.06 mg L-1 to 149.15 mg L-1 and 30.78 mg L-1 to 38.90 mg L-1, respectively.', 'removal waste aggregate', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Teknologi Industri (School of Industrial Technology)', '2018', 0);

The income-happiness puzzle (Easterlin Paradox) points out that individuals with higher incomes are happier than people with lower incomes yet raising everyoneâ€™s income does not compensate with overall higher levels of happiness. This thesis aims to examine income and subjective well-being in Malaysia. The research focuses on two measures of subjective well-being â€“ happiness and life satisfaction. Based on the wave 5 (2005-2009) and wave 6 (2010-2014) data obtained from the World Values Survey, this study addresses the issue of subjective well-being inequalities from different income groups. The survey was carried out in year 2006 for wave 5 and year 2011 for wave 6. People were happier and more satisfied in year 2011 compared to year 2006. However, over the same period, happiness and life satisfaction inequalities were found to be higher among the low-income group compared with the higher income groups. This study also examines the influence of absolute income, relative income and expected income on happiness and life satisfaction based on wave 6. Using the ordered logit regression analysis, it is found that higher absolute income contributes to greater happiness and satisfaction levels among Malaysians. In terms of the role of relative income on happiness, â€˜tunnel effectâ€™ is observed in particular among those in the low-income group. When compared with others who earn relatively higher income, Malaysians are less satisfied with life but the effect is found to be reversed in their happiness levels. Higher expected income seems to generate greater satisfaction among Malaysians.

Physiochemical activation consisting of potassium hydroxide (KOH) impregnation plus carbon dioxide (CO2) gasification was used to prepare the ACs. The optimum preparation conditions of RSCAC-CU were found at activation temperature of 793 Â°C, activation time of 1h and KOH impregnation ratio (IR) of 2.46. As for RSCAC-ZN, the optimum preparation conditions were at activation temperature of 797 Â°C, activation time of 1h and IR of 2.61. Meanwhile, the optimum preparation conditions of CCAC-CU were found at activation temperature of 762 Â°C, activation time of 2.7h and IR of 3.25. For CCAC-ZN, the optimum preparation conditions were at activation temperature of 768 Â°C, activation time of 3h and IR of 3.5.

In general this antenna is big in size with high tangent loss (tan Î´) and the bandwidth is narrow with low efficiency. These shortcomings can be solved by using ceramic materials with high dielectric constant (Îµr) and low tan Î´ such as CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO), known as dielectric resonator antenna (DRA). At 8 GHz, Îµr is 62.76 and tan Î´ is 0.1458 and resonated between 8.56 to 9.12 GHz with 6.6% bandwidth. However, its tan Î´ is still considered as on the higher side (>0.1) and bandwidth coverage is less than 10% which is not able to cover a wider portion of the X band (8 GHz to 12 GHz) communication system. Therefore, to enhance the properties of DRA, CCTO properties can be modified through the addition with other oxides. In this research, Al2O3, BaTiO3, TiO2 and CuO, respectively, was added from 20, 40, 50, 60, and 80 wt% into CCTO. It was found that addition of Al2O3 has reduced Îµr to 37.33 but has improved tan Î´ value to the lowest value of 0.0520. This antenna resonated between 8.67 to 9.26 GHz with 5.61% bandwidth (addition 20 wt% Al2O3). The addition of BaTiO3 has increased Îµr to 85.23 with addition 80 wt% and tan Î´ in these series between 0.0627 â€“ 0.0258. The result shows these composites resonated between 9.33 to 10.21 GHz with 8.91% bandwidth. The addition of 50 wt% of TiO2 shows Îµr of 56.47 and tan Î´ of these composites between 0.0165-0.1108, resonated from 10.03 to 11.36 GHz with 12.48% bandwidth. The highest Îµr (67.52) was obtained from 50 wt% CuO added to CCTO, improved tan Î´ (0.0203-0.0878) and resonated from 9.12 â€“ 11.29 GHz with 21.26% bandwidth. These results show that all samples (mixtures) can be applied as DRA but mixture of 50CCTO/50CuO shows the best performance compare to others. For that reason, this mixture was further optimized and finally produced high Îµr (67.52), low tan Î´ (0.0141) and can also covered broader frequency range in X band which is suitable for the fabrication of a smaller DRA with better performance.', 'synthesize composites resonator', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2018', 0),

(151, 'Abdul Malik Haider Yusef Saad', ' High-Speed Implementations Of Fractal Image Compression For Low And High Resolution Images', 'Fractal Image Compression (FIC) is a very popular coding technique that is used in image/video applications due to its simplicity and superior performance. The major drawback of FIC is that it is a time consuming algorithm, especially when a full search is attempted. Hence, it is very challenging to achieve a real-time operation especially when this algorithm is run on a general or graphic processor unit. Therefore, in this research new hardware implementations of FIC are proposed for accelerating the encoding process by means of parallelism and pipelining. Various approaches have been investigated for achieving high speed performance. The computational complexity of fractal operations are first investigated in order to select the minimum and efficient bit sizes that can provide similar or nearly similar encoding quality. This has resulted in a relatively new FIC hardware which is referred in this thesis as Design I. In this design, a full-search approach was adopted in order to enable reconstruction at highest possible quality. However, full-search scheme is not suitable for encoding larger images since the encoding time is increased dramatically when processing high-resolution images. This problem is solved in Design II which used a partial-search based scheme in order to achieve high-speed operation. This method exploits the inherently high degree of correlation between pixels in the neighbourhood areas in digital image to restrict the search space to those areas. By fixing these areas for each group of range blocks and partitioning an image in which each domain block contains four range blocks, enabled two matching operations be performed simultaneously. This reduced the memory access by half, thereby, doubling the speed by a factor of 2. This design was extended to encode RGB image, resulting in another new design referred to as Design III. In this design, the strong cross-correlation between the image components was exploited so that only the G component was encoded using the same approach as in Design II, while the R and B components were encoded by searchless-based scheme with direct mapping between overlapped blocks. All three designs were examined in terms of runtime, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR), and compression rate. The experimental results of Design I when implemented in Altera Cyclone II FPGA, showed speedup of 3 times, on average, while the PSNR was not significantly affected. Empirical results demonstrated that this firmware is competitive when compared to other existing full-search hardware with PSNR averaging at 30 dB, 5.82 % compression rate and a runtime of 9.8 ms. On the other hand, Design II was synthesised on Altera Stratix IV FPGA and showed an ability to encode a 1024Ã—1024 image at 395 MHz in 10.8 ms with PSNR averaging at 27 dB and compression rate of 34. These results suggest that the proposed approach enables colour images be encoded at approximately same speed as grayscale images. Also the proposed architectures have achieved better performance compared to the state-of-the-art designs, with speed averaging at 100, 92 and 83 fps for Design I, II and III respectively.', 'high-speed image resolution', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraaan Elektrik & Elektronik (School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering)', '2018', 0);

River bank filtration (RBF) is a good option to reduce surface water pollution and overcome water shortage problem especially during extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. Therefore, this study aims to reduce the possibility of DBPs formation by controlling the level of NOM and treating it together with bio-colloids and ionic pollutant by composite adsorbent Zeliac in RBF. Water quality monitoring study shows that NOM in Kerian River recorded an average of 3.6 mg/L DOC and 0.10 cm-1 UV254. Total coliform exceeded the raw water quality standard with an average concentration of 1.5x104 MPN/100 mL. The same mean level of UV254 (0.03 cm-1) was determined in the water from RBF and LBWTP. Meanwhile, higher level of DOC measured from final treated water (1.6 mg/L) than RBF (0.81 mg/L). For bio-colloids in RBF, no E. coli was present but total coliform was still detected in the water. Other determined parameters were also reduced except for Fe and Mn. This finding signifies the water abstracted from RBF well still requires further treatment to ensure the water is safe and clean for human consumption. The characteristics study of Zeliac shows that the adsorbent has a surface area of 40.6 m2/g and average pore size of 16.5 nm. The existence of Ca, Si and Al makes Zeliac a good cations exchanger. In addition, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups proved that Zeliac can attract positive ions or anionic organic pollutants depending on the water sample acidity. According to the equilibrium and kinetic study, the removal of pollutants was controlled by multilayer adsorption onto heterogeneous surface of Zeliac. At optimum dosage of 7 g per 100 mL sample, the removal efficiency of UV254, colour and NH3-N were 72.8% (0.129 â€“ 0.035 cm-1), 78.6% (42 - 9 PtCo) and 77.1% (0.70 â€“ 0.16 mg/L), respectively. In column adsorption experiments, it was found that granular size of Zeliac gave no significant effect to the removal performance.

A periodic inspection of the submerged platformâ€™s leg is needed. This research studies the possibility to involve an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in the underwater pole inspection application. A predefined inspection path is needed to increase the efficiency of the AUV in the inspection mission. Besides, a robust control technique is needed suppress the effect of unknown hydrodynamic parameters and external disturbances on the AUV system. As a solution, this research proposed a time-optimal inspection path specifically for vertical pole inspection by using grid-based Coverage Path Planning (CPP). A planar map is modelled to represent the 3D target environment of the pole. Five patterns of inspection paths are designed and compared to choose the best inspection path among them. Moreover, a robust tracking control law combined with robust filter and fuzzy logic control techniques is proposed. The robust filter control technique is used to compensate the effect of added mass, hydrodynamic damping, model nonlinearities, coupling effect, and external disturbances on the AUV system, whereas the fuzzy logic control technique is used to improve the force profile. Furthermore, an open frame box-shaped AUV prototype which is suitable for pole inspection application is developed to verify the performance of the proposed controller. The proposed inspection path is designed based on Boustrophedonâ€™s motion with smooth turning and vertical sweep direction. Calculation results show that the proposed inspection path can cover 99 % of the poleâ€™s surface by the shortest inspection time and shortest trajectory length compared to others. Besides, simulation results show that the force profile of the proposed controller has been improved by the added fuzzy logic controller. The maximum control force generated by the proposed controller is 8.7 N less than that of the robust filter with high natural frequency. From the simulation results, the frequency of control signal given by the proposed controller is 0.1 Hz, which is lower than 2 Hz of Model Free High Order Sliding Mode Control (MFHOSMC) and 100 Hz of Time Delay Control (TDC). Besides, the maximum steady state error of the proposed controller is 0.0023 m, which is comparable to 0.0003 m of MFHOSMC and 0.0095 m of TDC. Furthermore, experiment results showed that the control signal of proposed controller has lower average switching frequency and lower saturation percentage than the MFHOSMC and TDC.', 'robust vehicle underwater', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraaan Elektrik & Elektronik (School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering)', '2018', 0),

However, the effect of hydrodynamic on dynamical behavior of macroscopically scaled low gradient magnetic separation (LGMS) still remains unexplored even through it is particularly crucial in the design and optimization of magnetic separator for engineering applications. Therefore, it is the main purpose of this study is to understand the underlying mechanism of LGMS, especially to demonstrate the effect of hydrodynamic, and develop mathematical model to depict the dynamical behavior of this process. Evidently, magnetophoresis induced convective flow, which is resulted from hydrodynamic effect, was generated in MNP solution (even at very low particle concentration of 5 mg/L) subjected to low gradient magnetic field (<100 T/m) and significantly affects separation kinetics of it. Such induced convection is analogous to the natural convection found in heat transportation and can be characterized by the newly defined magnetic Grashof number. The analysis on magnetic Grashof number reveals that induced convection is only absent when particle concentration is below 0.05 mg/L. The intervention of hydrodynamic effect in LGMS has led to the two following phenomena: (1) the continuous homogenization of the MNP solution and (2) accompanying sweeping flow (convective velocity of 10-5 to 10-4 m/s was induced) that accelerates the collection of MNP (13 times fastercompared to the case without convection). Additionally, separation kinetics of hydrodynamically driven LGMS is solely controlled by the magnetic field gradient at the surface adjacent to the magnet (denoted as the â€œcollection plane of particlesâ€ in this work) as well as the area of this surface and is independent of the magnetic field distribution across the solution.

This study has been carried out to produce such composites with the use of paddy straw powder (PSP) in the poly lactic acid (PLA) or poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV). In this study, the effect of filler loading, treatment of natural filler and blending of two biopolymers on the mechanical, physical, thermal and biodegradability properties of composites were studied. Firstly, the PLA/PSP and PHBV/PSP composites containing 0-20 wt. % of PSP were prepared by using melt-blended mixing and compression molding method. The addition of PSP had resulted in reduced tensile strength for both of composites. The addition of PSP also showed reduction in thermal stability and has boosted up the water absorption percentages due to their hydrophilic nature. The tensile properties, FTIR, SEM and weight loss of soil buried samples proved the degradation activities over the predetermined time. In terms of comparison tensile strength of PHBV/PSP composites were lower than that of PLA/PSP composites. Thermal stability was also reduced but much lower as compared to PLA/PSP composites. After that the effect of chemical modification of PSP using acrylic acid (AA) and NaOH were studied on the mechanical properties, morphology and thermal properties of PLA/PSP composites. The treated composites with AA and NaOH have higher tensile properties compared to untreated composites. The chemical modification enhanced the thermal stability of treated composites. The FTIR analysis showed that chemical modification of PSP has reduced the hydroxyl group of PSP. The better interfacial interaction between PSP and PLA was proof by SEM. As compared both of the two types chemical modification, acrylic acid showed a good properties as compared to the sodium hydroxide. Furthermore, blending of two biopolymers which were PLA and PHBV was done in the ratio of 50:50. The PLA/PHBV blends were reinforced with the AA-treated PSP and the mechanical, thermal morphology and water absorption were studied. The tensile strength of the PLA/PHBV blends were slightly lower as compared to the pure PLA. The addition of the AA-treated PSP resulted in reduced tensile strength. As compared to the the PLA/PSP (AA-treated), the PLA/PHBV/PSP composites showed slightly lower tensile properties, thermal stability and water absorption. This may attributed to the relatively weak polymer-polymer interfaces and immiscibility between PLA and PHBV. Lastly, the fungal flora decomposing PLA/PSP and PHBV/PSP composites were investigated from the soil buried of these composites using streak plate method. 5 strains were isolated which are 3 strains from the PLA/PSP composites (PLA1, PLA2, PLA3) and 2 strains from PHBV/PSP composites PHBV1 and PHBV2). 18s sequencing method was applied in order to identify the species of the microorganisms. Based on the results, only two types of fungi, namely the Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichoderma harzianum were able to degrade the PLA/PSP composite, while for the PHBVB/PSP composite, two types of fungi also, namely the Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niveus, were involved.', 'physio biodegradation paddy-straw', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2017', 0),

However, EFL learnersâ€˜ collocational competence\r\nand factors that may affect this aspect of their language learning remain\r\nunder-investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate Chinese EFL\r\nlearnersâ€˜ use of verb-noun collocations and the relationship between the\r\nacceptability of their collocational use and four linguistic factors, namely, the degree\r\nof restriction of collocations, the congruence of collocations in learnersâ€˜ L1 and L2,\r\nthe use of delexical verbs in collocations, and frequency of collocations in native\r\nspeaker language. Data were collected from a self-built corpus of 142 argumentative\r\nessays written by junior and senior English majors in a university in China. All\r\nverb-noun combinations in several preselected syntactic structures were identified\r\nand subjected to acceptability judgments performed by the researcher based on\r\ncorpus and dictionary evidence and by four native speakers of English based on\r\nnative speaker intuition. Verb-noun collocations were distinguished from verb-noun\r\nfree combinations and idioms. Different types of deviations were identified and\r\npossible causes of deviations were analysed. Degree of restriction of collocations\r\nwas represented by the number of nouns the verbs collocate with in a particular\r\nsense. These numbers were obtained through exploring language data in the BNC \r\nxx\r\nand a collocation dictionary. Frequency of collocations in native speaker language\r\nwas represented by the frequency of collocations in the BNC, which was obtained\r\nthrough a combination of automatic and manual processes. Identification of L1-L2\r\ncongruence and the use of delexical verbs were based on criteria established by\r\nprevious studies. The results showed that about 34% of the collocations learners\r\nproduced were wrong, and close to 40% were deviant, which indicates that these\r\nadvanced learners in this study are seriously deficient in verb-noun collocations.\r\nResults of statistical analyses showed that degree of restriction of collocations is\r\nsignificantly correlated with acceptability of learnersâ€˜ collocational use. The more\r\nnouns the verb collocates with in a particular sense, the higher the probability of the\r\ncollocation being used inappropriately. L1-L2 congruence, the use of delexical verbs,\r\nand frequency of collocations were all found to be significantly positively correlated\r\nwith acceptability.

The development of a new vaccine as a replacement of Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) or to improve its efficacy is one of the goals mooted by the World Health Organization (WHO) to control TB. Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) is nonpathogenic and commensal in humans, which shares many characteristics with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Mycobacterial vectors including M. smegmatis have been successfully used in the development of experimental vaccines against TB. In the current study, recombinant M. smegmatis expressing selected Ag85B epitopes (P1, P2 and P3) was constructed (rMs064). The immunomodulatory effects of rMs064 were evaluated in J774A.1 murine macrophage cells. Our results demonstrated the capacity of rMs064 to induce the expression of the macrophage activation markers; MHC class II and CD40 molecules, and the production of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12p70 cytokines.Both rMs064 and M. smegmatis transformed with the empty plasmid (rMs012 as a control) were capable to induce phagocytic and mycobactericidal activity in macrophages as well as the production of IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± cytokines. In addition, J774A.1 macrophages infected with both rMs064 and rMs012 also increased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the production of nitric oxide (NO), which are crucial mediators of anti-mycobacterial activity. The induction of autophagy as quantified by LC3B-II detection in rMs064 infected macrophages showed inconclusive results in our experimental conditions. The capacity of rMs064 toinduce specific cellular and humoral immune responses in Balb/C mice against the expressed epitopes was evaluated. The proliferative responses of splenocytes from rMs064-immunized mice stimulated with P2 and P3 epitopes showed significant increase as compared to control groups. Cytokine production by splenocytes upon stimulation with Ag85B epitopes and serum specific IgG and its subclasses were determined. The results showed significant production of IL-12p70 and IL-23 when splenocytes were stimulated with P1, P2 and P3 epitopes in mice immunized with rMs064. In addition, significant IFN-Î³ production was found in splenocytes of rMs064-immunized mice when stimulated only with P1 epitope. For the evaluation of the T cell activation by rMs064, mice were immunized with rMs064, rMs012, PBS and KLH-85B.

Moreover, biotensegrity as a model emulated from the forms and functions of hierarchical biological system reveals its great potential in shape change ability. Therefore it is highly suitable to study biotensegrity as a new alternative choice for possible application where shape change ability is desired such as flexible arm in construction industry. However, there are limited studies on form finding of biotensegrity configurations and mathematical models on shape change of biotensegrity. Mimicking biological system by their shape, pertinent anatomical dimensions and natural curvature of human spine to seek its potential in shape change beneficial to application like automated robotic tools is the overall aim of this study. Specifically, this basic study aims to (1) formulate mathematical procedures for finding self-equilibrated configurations of spine biotensegrity structure (SBS) models (2) formulate computational strategy for simulating the shape change of novel SBS models, and (3) evaluate the characteristics of the novel SBS models. The methodology for this study consists of three phases. In the first phase, assemblage and mathematical formulation procedure for form finding of self-equilibrated four-stage class 1 biotensegrity models inspired by human spine or spine biotensegrity (SBS) models are established. The form-finding procedure involves method of solving the system of equilibrium equations through the use of Moore-Penrose generalized inverse, determination of self-equilibrium stress modes via eigenvector basis decomposition and optimization of coefficients for the linear combination of linearly independent selfequilibrium stress modes. Advantageous features of human spine like the slenderness and natural curvature in the geometry, as well as the stabilizing network consist of spinal column and muscle are incorporated in the mathematical formulation of the configuration of the SBS models. Additionally, two specific approaches in modification of nodal coordinates are implemented to improve the efficiency for form-finding of self-equilibrated SBS models, i.e. by means of adjustment of twist angles and modification of initial nodal coordinates. After successful searching of the configuration of self-equilibrated SBS models, the ability of the models to undergo shape change to achieve the prescribed state is investigated in the second phase. Specifically, unconstrained nodes of SBS model are chosen as monitored nodes where these nodes are required to reach a set of target displacements in prescribed magnitudes and directional modes. The shape change of SBS models towards target state is achieved by means of forced elongation of cable. Computational strategies for the shape change consist of two stages: the derivation of incremental equilibrium equations and optimization of the cables forced elongation by sequential quadratic programming. In the third phase, the structural characteristics of SBS models such as the deformed configurations and changes of axial force at the end of shape change analysis are investigated. The following four cases of target displacements are studied in order to investigate the characteristics of SBS models after shape change: uni-, bi-, tri-directional and twisting modes. The current study has successfully formulated mathematically the self-equilibrated configuration of SBS models inspired by human spine. A total of three novel selfequilibrated configurations of SBS models were searched. This study has also proposed a set of procedures involving incremental calculation for shape change analysis of SBS models. Numerical simulations of the regular tensegrity and SBS models have proven the superior convergent characteristic of the proposed algorithm for shape change analysis. The results reveal that the proposed approach for shape change analysis has a very strong ability for a self-equilibrated model to search their desired target coordinates in multi-directional modes through optimization of the forced elongation in cables. It is also found that the SBS models are capable to undergo bending, axial and torsional deformation. Active changes in forces in element groups even within the far-away element groups of SBS models are observed during the shape change analysis. In conclusion, the findings of this basic study have paved the way for realization of spine inspired flexible arm with magnitude shape change ability.', 'form analysis bio-tensegrity', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Awam (School of Civil Engineering', '2017', 0),

Therefore, producing a hybrid filler that contains more than one filler is necessary. Recently carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were hybridized with others fillers to achieve the combined effects of the filler. The combinations of the filler (hybrid filler) should have a strong physical and chemical interaction with each other in order to achieve the optimum reinforcing effect. This study proposed the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method to produce a CNTs hybrid with inorganic fillers and this synthesised CNTs hybrid, was used as filler in phenolic composites. The first part of the research was the investigation of the CNTs/alumina hybrid and its processing parameter such as calcinations temperatures and duration. The comparative study of hybrid CNTs using the CVD method and the physical method (conventional) on the properties of the phenolic composite were also studied. The phenolic composites were fabricated via hot mounting process. The tribological properties were investigated using a pin-on-disk tester under different sliding conditions. The results showed that 10 hours duration of calcination and 900oC were the best parameters to growth the CNTs hybrid. The result also revealed that hybridising the CNTs via CVD improves the hardness, thermal conductivity and tribological properties of the phenolic hybrid composite. In the second part of the research, empirical models with different independent variables for the tribological behaviour of CNTs/alumina filled phenolic composites were developed using the response surface methodology (RSM) approach. The optimisation of the response as a function of the independent variable was generated. It shows that 5HYB/PHENOLIC exhibited better wear performance than 5PHY/PHENOLIC composites.In the third part, the suitability of calcium carbonate, talc and dolomite to growth the CNTs in the production of CNTs/inorganic hybrid compounds using the CVD method was investigated. The results showed that the CNTs growth on the calcium carbonate, talc and dolomite particles, which means they are also suitable as a support material in CNTs hybrids (growth using a nickel metal catalyst and methane as the carbon feedstock at 800oC).

(237, 'Lee Woon Kiow', 'Detection Of Chipping In Ceramic Cutting Inserts From Workpiece Profile Signature During Turning Process Using Machine Vision', 'Ceramic tools are prone to chipping due to their low impact toughness. Tool chipping significantly decreases the surface finish quality and dimensional accuracy of the workpiece. Thus, in-process detection of chipping in ceramic tools is important especially in unattended machining. Existing in-process tool failure detection methods using sensor signals have limitations in detecting tool chipping. The monitoring of tool wear from the workpiece profile using machine vision has great potential to be applied in-process, however no attempt has been made to detect tool chipping. In this work, a vision-based approach has been developed to detect tool chipping in ceramic insert from 2-D workpiece profile signature. The profile of the workpiece surface was captured using a DSLR camera. The surface profile was extracted to sub-pixel accuracy using invariant moment method. The effect of chipping in the ceramic cutting tools on the workpiece profile was investigated using autocorrelation function (ACF) and fast Fourier transform (FFT). Detection of onset tool chipping was conducted by using the sub-window FFT and continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Chipping in the ceramic tool was found to cause the peaks of ACF of the workpiece profile to decrease rapidly as the lag distance increased and deviated significantly from one another at different workpiece rotation angles. From FFT analysis the amplitude of the fundamental feed frequency increases steadily with cutting duration during gradual wear, however, fluctuates significantly after tool has chipped. The stochastic behaviour of the cutting process after tool chipping leads to a sharp increase in the amplitude of spatial frequencies below the fundamental feed frequency. CWT method was found more effective to detect the onset of toolchipping at 16.5 s instead of 17.13 s by sub-window FFT. Root mean square of CWT coefficients for the workpiece profile at higher scale band was found to be more xxiv sensitive to chipping and thus can be used as an indicator to detect the occurrence of the tool chipping in ceramic inserts.', 'detection ceramic workpiece', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Mekanikal (School of Mechanical Engineering)', '2017', 0),

Hydrotalcite (HT) catalyst prepared using combustion method was employed with some structural modification in order to develop acid-base bifunctionalized HT. The acid-base bifunctionalized HT was meant to be beneficial in conducting simultaneous transesterification and esterification reaction. The use of ultrasound-assisted system could overcome the emulsification and mass transfer limitations due to immiscibility of oil and alcohol. Hence, reaction time could be significantly shortened. Two important parameters to synthesize MgAl based HT i.e. calcination temperature (550 oCâ€“850 oC) and fuel type (saccharose, glucose and fructose) were particularly investigated. Alteration on MgAl based HT structure was done by introducing second divalent metals (nickel, copper and zinc). The amphoteric properties of these transition metals successfully resulted in bifunctional acid-base properties of HT. The structural, crystallinity, surface morphology, thermal decomposition, bonding characteristics and acid strength of the synthesized HT were elucidated by several characterization techniques. The dependence of HTâ€™s characteristics on the synthesis parameters and correlations with their catalytic performance under ultrasound condition were successfully studied. The MgAl based HT catalyst prepared using saccharose and calcined at 650 oC showed high biodiesel yield (about 76.45 %) in just 60 minutes in the presence of low ultrasound amplitude (~11 kHz). Meanwhile, HT introduced with 10 % nickel demonstrated the highest FAME yield of about 86.84 % in just 60 minutes. The simultaneous transesterification and esterification reactions were evidently demonstrated by carrying out the FFA test reaction. The FAME yield was found to increase due to the esterification of FFA to FAME. The HT catalyst synthesized was highly stable which was capable to perform several cycles of reaction with significantly low total FAME reduction (4.52 %) and with no significant leaching of active component. The optimization study successfully demonstrated effects of 4 independent reaction variables i.e. reaction time (30-90 min), methanol to oil ratio (7:1-23:1), amplitude (40-60 %) and catalyst amount (0.06-0.08 g catalyst/ g oil). A quadratic model is generated with 95.84 % of confidence level. The most reasonable optimum parameters with the smallest error (1.15 %) are identified. The quality of the obtained FAME was evaluated which conform to the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 specifications. Lastly, kinetic study was also investigated and the apparent activation energy for the simultaneous transesterification and esterification reactions (73.11 kJ/mol) is lower than that of transesterification reaction (81.16 kJ/mol) which indicates an accelerated reaction.', 'acid-based biodiesel reactor-system', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Kimia (School of Chemical Engineering)', '2016', 0),

However, its low fracture toughness limited the usage of ZTA in many engineering applications. Therefore, the enhancement of fracture toughness is necessary. Nonetheless, it is crucial to maintain high hardness and enhance the fracture toughness to make ZTA more reliable for technological applications. In-situ formation of elongated CaAl12O19 grains inside ZTA ceramics during sintering process is preferred. This is due to its easy to be sintered, safety from health hazards and to avoid more complicated and less economical methods of sintering. CaO and CaCO3 powders were added into ZTA, wet-mixed, uniaxially pressed and ZTA samples formed by pressureless solid state sintering. The current study is divided to three parts. The first part is the addition of CaCO3 alone into ZTA. The fracture toughness was improved from 5.95 MPa.m1/2 for pure ZTA to 6.3 MPa.m1/2 for ZTA added with 0.5 wt. % of CaCO3 due to crack deflection mechanism along elongated CaAl12O19 grains. However, the hardness decreased due to emission of CO2 which creates porous microstructure. Hence, CaO and CaCO3 added together into ZTA to reduce the porosity and simultaneously, obtain elongated CaAl12O19 grains which enhances the fracture toughness of ZTA through crack deflection and crack bridging mechanisms. In the second part, combination addition between CaO with CaCO3 was fixed at 0.5 wt. %. The hardness was improved and better fracture toughness was obtained due to less xxii porous microstructure of ZTA and control of the size and shape of CaAl12O19 grains. The optimum ZTA composition was added with 0.4 wt. % CaO combined with 0.1 wt. % CaCO3. This composition has the maximum fracture toughness (6.51 MPa.m1/2) and reasonable hardness (1592 HV). Therefore, the CaO/CaCO3 ratio of 4:1 was selected as the base for the third part. The third part is to study the interaction effects of three parameters: sintering temperature, soaking time and combination addition between CaO and CaCO3 on the two responses: fracture toughness and Vickers hardness of ZTA. The Design of Experiments (DOE) was implemented to reduce the number of tests and meanwhile the optimisation process was employed to optimise the effective range of responses. After applying Response Surface Methodology (RSM), it was proved that sintering temperature is the most influence parameter on the fracture toughness and hardness of ZTA ceramics. The optimum results (fracture toughness of 6.84 MPa.m1/2 and hardness 1615 HV) obtained from sintering temperature at 1600 Â°C, combination addition between CaO and CaCO3 of 0.95 wt.%, and soaking time for 2.14 hr. The other designs such as Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Lack of Fit (LOF), 3D mapping and Residual Analysis have also confirmed the adequacy of the result. However, confirmation results obtained from experiments found that the optimum results (fracture toughness 7.1 MPa.m1/2 and Vickers hardness was 1584 HV) were obtained from 1.05 wt.% of combination addition between CaO and CaCO3 into ZTA samples, sintering temperature of 1600 Â°C and soaking time of 2.9 hr.

(259, 'Iylia Binti Idris', 'Direct Contact Membrane Distillation for Palm Oil Mill Effluent Treatment. ', 'Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is a major waste produced by the palm oil industry. The increase in the production of POME has caused environmental pollution, which ultimately has adverse effects on humans and aquatic life. POME is discharged at high temperature (~ 90 degree Celsius), requires days and spaces to cool it before undergone conventional treatment. Viewing the potential of reducing the treatment period, spaces and heat wasted to the environment, a direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) treatment system was investigated consisting of pre-treatment and membrane processes. Coagulation study identify optimum coagulant dosage obtained was 4 g/L at pH 6.5, and the percentage of suspended solids removal was found to be 82% at 50 Â°C. The application of the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was studied using two types of membranes: modified and unmodified PVDF hollow fibre membranes. Modified PVDF membrane was carried out to increase the hydrophobicity (contact angle: 150.3 Â± 1.1Â°) through coating with Low density polyethylene (LDPE) solution. The highest flux was obtained at 80 Â°C for both types of membranes. The permeate water fluxes for unmodified and modified PVDF hollow fiber membranes were 2.63 L/m2.h and 2.38 L/m2.h, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that the unmodified PVDF hollow fiber membrane could not withstand long operation times compared to the modified PVDF hollow fiber membrane. The TPC values obtained for the modified PVDF hollow fiber membrane ranged between 0.57 to 0.62 at a temperature range of 60 to 80 Â°C. Meanwhile, the TPC values for the unmodified PVDF hollow fiber membrane at 60 to 80 Â°C were 0.59 to 0.64. This process can be classified as a well-designed system. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a simple simulation that was implemented to carry out predictions of the permeate water flux. A multilayer Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (FANN) model was developed with three input variables (feed temperature, feed velocity, and type of membrane) and one output (permeate water flux) with 18 experimental data points. This optimized FANN model consisted of 1 hidden layer with 13 hidden neurons. The lowest mean square error (MSE) obtained was 0.0034, while the regression coefficient (R) values for training, validation, and testing were 0.9859, 0.9986, and 0.9984, respectively. These results showed a good training and performance agreement between the ANN modelâ€™s predicted data and the experimental data. The selectivity analysis was done to determine the sensitivity of the operating parameters. The most sensitive parameter was the feed temperature compared to feed velocity. The DCMD system is highly potential to replace the conventional treatment of POME.

However, the performance of CAD is limited by two main issues; (i) unwanted regions (i.e. high-intensity rectangular label, tape, artefact, skin-air interface, etc.) could disturb the detection of breast cancer and reduce the accuracy rate of CAD, (ii) the irregularity of mammogramsâ€™ texture in which features such as entropy, energy, skewness, kurtosis, mean, and standard deviation are correlated in the spatial domain and insignificant for classification. Therefore, to address the aforementioned problems, an improved CAD system for the mammogram image is proposed. The proposed CAD consists of three main stages, namely pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification of mammogram images. In pre-processing step, Adaptive Multilevel Threshold (AMLT) is proposed, which successfully removes the above-mentioned unwanted regions. It gives the advantage to the system where it allows the search for abnormalities to be constrained to the region of the breast tissue without the effect of the unwanted regions in the image background. In feature extraction stage, two new features, namely medians of maximum and minimum of high-frequency subbands have been proposed to classify the mammogram images into normal, benign and malignant. Box plot analysis has proven that both new features are uncorrelated and significant for classification of mammogram images as compared to the conventional features. In the classification stage, multilayer perceptron (MLP) network is employed to classify normal and abnormal mammograms in the first phase and benign and malignant in the second phase. The average results produced from 322 mammogram images in the first phase concluded that the proposed approach attained reliable results with an accuracy of 96.27%, sensitivity of 94.78% and specificity of 96.60%. In addition, the average results produced from 115 abnormal images for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 95.65%, 96.18%, and 95.38% respectively.

Based on the current situation, the conversion of glycerol to higher value products like monoglyceride is an attractive alternative. In the present work, mesoporous SZSBA-15 catalyst has been synthesized with different zirconia loadings (5 - 20 wt. %) and final calcination temperatures (450 â€“ 650 oC). The synthesized catalysts were characterized by means of surface analysis, SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, EDX, TGA, NH3-TPD and determination of acidity by titration. The characteristics of the catalyst were then correlated with the catalytic activity in glycerol esterification with palmitic acid and the performance was demonstrated based on the palmitic acid conversion and monopalmitin yield. Effects of reaction conditions such as time (1 â€“ 6 h), N2 flow rate (5 â€“ 40 cm3/min), reaction temperature (160 â€“ 180 oC), catalyst loading (1 â€“ 3 wt. %) and glycerol/palmitic acid molar ratio (2:1 â€“ 6:1) were also elucidated and correlated with the characteristics of the catalysts. It was found that SZSBA-15 catalyst prepared using 10 wt. % of zirconia loading and calcined at 500 oC (10SZSBA-15(500)) demonstrated high activity in the production of monopalmitin. An increase in the reaction time, nitrogen flow rate, reaction temperature and catalyst loading increased the conversion of palmitic acid. On the contrary, changes in the palmitic acid conversion was insignificant when the molar ratio exceeded 4:1. On top of that, the best reaction conditions were obtained at a reaction time of 3 h, a reaction temperature of 170 oC, 2 wt. % of catalyst loading and 4:1 of glycerol/palmitic acid molar ratio. Under these conditions using 10SZSBA-15(500) catalyst, 86 % of palmitic acid conversion and 43 % monopalmitin yield were obtained. In terms of reusability, this catalyst was reusable for up to four times in this reaction with slight decrease in the catalytic activity. This was attributed to the loss of sulfur groups from the catalyst. Nevertheless, the pore structure remained unaffected after four catalytic cycles. The glycerol esterification with palmitic acid was found to follow a second order kinetic model with respect to glycerol and palmitic acid with a low activation energy of 38.2 kJ/mol.

This study explores the unsolved issues that have been debated for more than 50 years and provides critical insights into the current regulatory issues confronting the auditing profession in Malaysia. The issue of auditor independence on nonaudit services has become a concern to the academicians, researchers, and regulators, especially Securities and Exchange Commissions (SECs) not only in the US, UK, Australia, but also worldwide, including Malaysia. The Enron case in the US and the other collapsed companies throughout the world, including Tramsmile and Megan Media in Malaysia, has raised question on the credibility of external auditor and the governance aspect. Most of the anecdotal evidence claim that the provision of nonaudit services might impair auditor independence and reduce the earnings quality. Previous studies have provided mixed evidence that nonaudit services affect auditorâ€™s independence (due to economic bonding) and nonaudit services yields knowledge spillover and improve auditor efficiency. Past researchers have suggested that nonaudit services should be categorised into types and recurring and nonrecurring to get clear picture on the impairment in auditorâ€™s independence.', 'nonaudit corporate auditor ', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Siswazah Perniagaan (Graduate School of Business) ', '2016', 0),

Due to the structural design of the OBS that has great potential to promote optimal treatment processes, it is very crucial to study its operating system. This intention is in line with the current demand on wastewater treatment system, which not only focusing on the achievement of specified effluent quality standards, but also taking into consideration other aspects such as economic and environmental. Because of this reason, the study was conducted to understand the complicated process of OBS. The preliminary process model and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model were used to obtain a better picture of the OBS. Three-dimensional, two-phase and an open channel CFD-based model was developed to study the mechanism of OBS. In the study, the CFD model was used to represent the OBS to overcome some of the limitations of the preliminary process model. The simulation results were used to study the flow pattern across the ditch, the velocity distribution at different depths, velocity distribution for different operating conditions, the volume fraction of air and water in the ditch, the pressure distribution across the channels and hydraulic residence time. The results of CFD model were used to calculate more specific volumetric flow rate, the Oxygen Utilization Rate (OUR) of the ditch and the power consumption associated with the values of OUR. Based on the study on the effect of different operating shafts on the performance of OBS, it was found that turning off the combination of shaft 2 (outer channel) and shaft 6 (middle and inner channel) was contributing to less power consumption but still having almost the same average OUR value (26,483 kg/d) like the real case (26,594 kg/d). The results show that although these shafts are turned off, but the biological reactions inside the ditch still occur as the biological reactions when all the shafts are operated. Forecast future power consumption associated with the OUR values, which may occur due to effluent quality standards that are more stringent, was also presented and discussed in this study. Based on the results, the outermost channels recorded the highest overall oxygen consumption, which is 79% compared with the middle channel with only 9%, followed by inner channel with 12%. In the future, if more stringent effluent quality standards imposed, the rate of oxygen consumption will definitely increase. If the rate of oxygen consumption at present, namely 21,109 kg/d increased to 30%, it will lead to increased electricity use by 3,241 MW/year (nearly RM 1,092,284/year). The research provides a better understanding on how this simulation tool will be able to be applied within wastewater process modelling.

Thus, the SiO2-H2O, Al2O3-H2O, Fe2NiO4 and diamond-H2O served as the working fluids with nanoparticle mass concentrations ranged from 0 to 3 % in LHP was employed. This study has five distinct parts. First, experimental apparatus and procedures were designed and implemented for measurements of the surface temperature of LHP. Second, a 3D model based on the heat transfer by conducting where the LHP as a whole was modeled by assuming it as a conducting medium, without taking into account the events occurring inside the LHP. The aim of this work is to compare the temperature of solid surface of LHP with experimental results. Third, a 3D model based on the characterization of the working fluid inside the LHP to give an insight into the heat transfer and fluid flow mechanism was developed and tested in ANSYS-Fluent Software. Fourth, as an excellent tool for experiment design and optimization, Design of Experiment (DOE) was employed to optimize the nanofluid mass concentration and the heat input to get the best performance of the LHP. For the SiO2-H2O and Fe2NiO4-H2O-charged LHP, there existed an optimal concentration of 0.5% and 1%, at which reductions in the overall thermal resistance (Rth) of about 2.7oC/W (or 5.84%) and 2.6oC/W (or 7.17%), respectively, were obtained as compared with pure water. For the Al2O3-H2O and diamond-H2O-charged LHP, the Rth decreased with the increase in the mass concentration of nanoparticles. Fifth, a commercial liquid cooling kit of LHP system similar as used in experimental study was installed in real desktop PC CPU. The test results of the proposed system indicate that the average decrease of 5.75oC (14%) was achieved in core temperatures of desktop PC CPU charged with diamond-H2O as compared with pure water.

This study investigated volatile constituents of hot water extract (HWE), cold water extract (CWE) and crude (CRD) L. rhinocerus using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The anti-asthmatic potential of L. rhinocerus extracts was investigated on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation Sprague Dawley rats. Immunomodulatory effects of L. rhinocerus were carried out in BALB/c mice. Sequential extractions of L. rhinocerus using five solvents (petroleum ether, diethyl ether, hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol) were conducted prior to GC-MS analysis. Overall, 44 constituents were identified from CRD L. rhinocerus. Compounds from the fatty acid group were the most predominant (68.58%) and the main constituent was linoleic acid (49.39%). GC-MS analysis of HWE L. rhinocerus identified 18 constituents with the main compound also linoleic acid (21.35%).

MANETs are popular in locations that lack a fixed communication infrastructure, such as in natural disaster sites and battlefields. The varying densities of mobile nodes from one sub-area to another are referred to as non-uniform node densities. The communication between nodes in a network with non-uniform density faces the challenge of low connectivity, in which nodes are susceptible to link breakages. Such condition affects the Quality of Service (QoS) in networks. Typically, a non-uniform node density influences network performance. For instance, packet delivery ratio is expected to be high in high-density sub networks and low in low-density sub networks.

Pengubahsuaian pada permukaan telah dilakukan melalui dua pendekatan iaitu penyaduran dengan Pluronic F127 ko-polimer yang telah menstabilkan sampel ZnO-I dan pencahayaan UVA telah menghasilkan sampel ZnOâ€“UVA. TEM dan FESEM menunjukkan rod nano dan mikro sebagai struktur utama dalam ZnO-UVA dan ZnO -I selain daripada plat nano dan mikro dalam struktur dimensi yang berbeza. Manakala ZnO-II terdiri daripada plat nano dan mikro termasuk beberapa nanorods, tetrapod dan struktur lain. Analisis XRD menunjukkan sifat kristal kesemua sampel dan penghabluran. ESI menunjukkan pengagihan Zn dan O atom pada struktur ZnO dengan pemetaan yang menunjukkan nisbah O:Zn. Nisbah Zn yang tinggi menyebabkan kadar pennyaherapan oksigen yang lebih tinggi pada permukaan ZnO-UVA dan ZnO-I yang meningkat kekonduksian-foto (7.51nS dan 5.19nS masing-masing, manakala ZnO-II menunjukkan 1.49nS). The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the structural, morphological, optical and physiochemical properties of zinc oxide nanoaprticles (ZnO-NPs) with their correlation on anti-cancer activity towards human cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa). The antibacterial activity of ZnO-NPs towards E.coli and Shigella Flexneri was studied as well to get considerable indication of the bioactivity of ZnO-NPs. Three ZnO-NPs samples were used, initially a systematical comprehensive characterization for their structural, morphological (FESEM, TEM, ESI, EDS, XRD), optical (UV-Vis absorption and FTIR), and electrical (I-V measurements, zeta potential) properties have been carried out. Surface modification was performed via coating with Pluronic F-127 copolymer obtained stabilized sample, namely ZnO-I. And UVA illumination, the sample recalled, ZnO-UVA, while the third sample, was bare denoted ZnO-II. TEM and FESEM showed major nano/micro- rods structures in ZnO-UVA and ZnO-I and nano/micro plated structures of different dimensions. ZnO-II showed mainly nano/micro plates and some nanorods, few tetrapod and other structures. TEM showed particle sizes around 80 nm, and XRD analysis revealed the crystallinity of the samples whereas ESI displayed the elemental maps of Zn and O atoms of ZnO structures showing the ratios of O: Zn. Higher Zn ratio resulted in higher desorption of oxygen on ZnO-UVA and ZnO-I surfaces, revealed by the increased photoconductivities of 7.51 nS and 5.19 nS, respectively, while ZnO-II showed 1.49 nS.', 'zinc-oxide bioactivity escherichia', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Sains Fizik (School of Physics) ', '2016', 0),

The aim of this study is to develop a machine-to-machine (M2M) communication by embedding an active RFID technology with wireless mesh sensor network (WMSN) platform with heterogeneous data transfer to monitor and identify the household electrical consumption. A household electrical power meter is designed with chosen Zigbee-Pro as a RF transceiver module with WSN functionalities to communicate between RFID tag to the RFID reader wirelessly. The development of this project involves three main parts in the proposed RFID communication system which consists of: the EPRFID (embedded RFID module with household electrical power meter), reader and application software at a work station. The EPRFID module is designed to take power supply from a household electric power meter with the introduction of power management circuit developed inside the proposed module. It comprises of voltage and current sensors which is functioning to precisely sense the actual status of the resident electrical power consumption from the appliance loads. Then, the data signal is directly transferred to the central processing unit (CPU) to precisely calculate the current power consumption. The CPU is the central part to effectively communicate and command all defined operations. The real time clock is readily available to generate the local real time clock. It is combined into the memory module package which used to minute the total accumulated power. Simultaneously, the display unit shows the monitored information data such as local time, current, voltage and power values. Lastly, the application software at a personal computer (PC) was designed by using the Microsoft Visual C# software. It shows the performances of received information data from the end meter devices such as tag ID, time sent, receive, delay, accumulated power, RSSI and amount of received bytes. In this research, the EPRFID prototype was intensively examined as follows: the voltage and current calibration versus the distance ranges; the transmitted power calibration; energy analysis; energy tradeoffs based on measured dc characteristics; anti collision performance; radiation pattern; maximum read range; tag collection and latency delay time; throughput evaluation. The experimental results indicated that the proposed EPRFID prototype successfully worked wirelessly with tolerable power consumption is within a range of 1.61 W to 1.69 W. This model is to facilitate some daily life processes, saving time, and reduces the operating cost because of the reduction in the manpower requirement and error in information system that can be omitted through humans. Thus, improving the M2M communication can provide higher reliability on the communication system because the current development will focus on local control strategies. In addition, this study can be guidelines to the electrical power utility company and consumers for alternatives in electrical consumption billings in the future.', 'electrical wireless network', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraaan Elektrik & Elektronik (School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering)', '2016', 0),

The research works generate a steady output at a frequency of 956 MHz for RF energy harvesting system. The design of the circular spiral antenna is performed using Computer Simulation Technology (CST) and Advanced Designed System (ADS). The circular spiral antenna is integrated with the rectifying circuit to efficiently convert the input RF signal from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). Three configurations of the antenna designs were proposed namely single circular spiral antenna, 1x2 circular spiral antenna and 2x4 circular spiral antenna. The proposed antenna that had been developed is based on the basic antenna characteristic such as return loss, radiation pattern and gain. The 1x2 array antennas and 2x4 array antenna were designed using the corporate feed method that will increase the gain and enhanced the RF harvesting output voltage. The rectification of RF to DC energy used zero bias schottky diode that convert the incoming harvested energy. The results show that all the three design posses gain of 2.3 dBi, 3.2 dBi and 5 dBi, while the output voltage generated were 17 mV, 59.4 mV and 79 mV respectively.

Whilst shape memory effect is a unique advantage of NiTi shape memory alloy like, no successful attempt so far to produce single phase NiTi with good transformation. NiTi produced via solid state synthesis have complex microstructures involving multiple phases of Ti2Ni and TiNi3. These phases do not exhibit martensitic transformation and jeopardise the shape memory behaviour of NiTi. Apart from that, the formation of oxides may hinder the formation of single phase NiTi. Therefore, this research examines the processing conditions that produce single phase NiTi with optimum transformation behaviour and also identifies the possible obstacles for forming single phase NiTi. This study synthesised Ni-Ti and Ni-TiH2 powder mixtures in flowing argon and reducing environment using CaH2 and MgH2 powder as the in situ reducing agent. Several effects of parameters such as sintering temperature, time, composition, and post-sintering were studied and a systematic comparative investigation was performed on phase formation, transformation behaviour, shape memory effect, and deformation behaviour of the sintered specimen. Elemental powder sintering of Ni-Ti did not result in single phase NiTi and no distinct peaks of martensitic transformation were observed on the sintered specimens. The use of TiH2 to replace Ti increased the volume fraction of NiTi and displayed martensitic transformation peaks, albeit with low transformation heat (â‰¤13 J/g) revealing that oxidation is an active obstacle in producing single phase NiTi. Synthesis of Ni-TiH2 in reducing the environment, especially the use of CaH2 as an in situ reducing agent, resulted in the formation of single phase NiTi with enthalpy change of ~25-26 J/g, similar to melt-cast NiTi alloys. The surface analysis showed a significant reduction in oxide formation, thus minimising the effects on balanced composition between Ni and Ti. This reflects that an oxygen-free environment allows unhindered Ni-Ti reaction, which leads to the formation of single-phase NiTi. This work established the fact that, other than the thermodynamic considerations often being discussed in similar work as obstacles to single phase formation, oxidation appears to have profound effects on single phase formation in NiTi synthesized in solid state.', 'formation alloy processing', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Mekanikal (School of Mechanical Engineering)', '2016', 0),

This is attributed to its rapid recombination of charge carriers, and loses of particles by flowing water during photodegradation process. In this research, ZnO rods were synthesized by solution precipitation method. By studying synthesis parameters such as capping agent (PVP), growth duration and growth temperature, ZnO rods with the best photocatalytic performance in removal of RhB dye under UV irradiation were synthesized using PVP at growth duration of 30 min and growth temperature of 90 oC. These ZnO rods achieved photodegradation efficiency of 98.8 % and rate constant of 0.058 minâ€’1 after 75 min UV irradiation, respectively. It is noted that although ZnO nanodisks offered a larger (002) polar surface, their photodegradation efficiency was poor as compared to ZnO rods. Refined growth mechanisms of stacked ZnO rods and ZnO nanodisks are proposed based on the zeta potential analysis. In order to improve the photocatalytic performance, Ni particles were deposited onto the ZnO rods using solution precipitation method, followed by calcination and reduction in H2 atmosphere at 500 oC for 2 h. The deposition of Ni particles on the surface of ZnO rods was confirmed by the results of field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscope (TEM), room temperature photoluminescence (RTPL) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Ni/ZnO nanocomposites experienced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect in RTPL measurement with a RUV/Vis ratio up to 40.6. However, this unique optical property did not favor for the photocatalytic performance of ZnO rods. The Ni particles introduced defects (recombination centers) which deteriorated the photocatalytic activity of Ni/ZnO nanocomposites. The best Ni/ZnO nanocomposites, with photodegradation efficiency of 61.7 % and rate constant of 0.033 minâ€’1 (after 30 min UV irradiation), were produced under calcination temperature of 500 oC and 0.03 M of nickel nitrate solution concentration. The WOx/ZnO nanocomposites were synthesized using solution precipitation method too. The WOx particles consisted of a mixture of WO2 and WO3 as proven by XPS analysis. Generally, >90 % photodegradation efficiency of RhB dye removal could achieved at 30 min by these WOx/ZnO nanocomposites as compared only 74.4 % by ZnO rods. In order to minimize the lost of particles in water system, WOx/ZnO nanocomposites were grown on PET fibers. This was achieved by depositing WOx particles on the ZnO rods pre-grown on the PET fibers. The optimized photocatalytic performance (RhB solution under stagnant condition, UV irradiation) was achieved for WOx/ZnO nanocomposites prepared at 0.01 M sodium tungstate solution in which the photodegradation efficiency and rate constant are 89.5 % and 0.030 minâ€’1, respectively.

Initially, non-catalytic supercritical methanol (SCM) was carried out by utilizing sea mango oil as triglycerides (TG) feedstock. Statistical analysis method of design of experiment (DOE) was employed to investigate the effect of reaction time, reaction temperature and molar ratio of methanol to oil in the range of 10 â€“ 50 min, 320 â€“ 400 Â°C and 20 â€“ 60 mol/mol, respectively. The optimum conditions were found to be 380 Â°C, 40 min and 45:1 mol/mol of methanol to oil, resulting in 78 % w/w biodiesel content. Subsequently, development of mathematical model based on SCM reaction mechanism was conducted. This maiden model of FAME production incorporating both reversible transesterification and esterification was verified using an ordinary differential equation (ODE45) solver. The highest activation energy of 40 kJ/mol and the lowest reaction rate constant of 2.50 Ã—10-5 dm3/mol s confirmed that the first stepwise reaction of TG to produce diglycerides (DG) was the rate-limiting step in SCM system. Apart from that, new technology which is non-catalytic superheated methanol vapour (SMV) was developed for transesterification and esterification of oil feedstock. In the initial development, jatropha curcas oil was utilized as TG feedstock in the SMV system. The effects of reaction time, reaction temperature, methanol flow rate and initial oil mass on the FAME production rate and FAME content were studied at the range of 0 â€“ 240 min, 260 â€“ 300 Â°C, 1 â€“ 3 mL/min and 40.0 â€“ 70.0 g, respectively. Results obtained showed that the highest biodiesel yield at 71.54 % w/w was achieved at reaction temperature of 290 Â°C, methanol flow rate at 2 mL/min for the initial oil mass at 40.0 g with 88.81 % w/w FAME content, implying the huge potential of SMV technology in producing FAME. In addition, it was observed that higher FAME production rate can be obtained when the initial oil mass is increased. Therefore, initial oil mass was fixed at higher volume which was 100 mL and experimental system was modified by replacing the preheater to a high temperature crucible furnace and introducing obstacle into the reaction chamber. Sea mango oil was utilized after modification had been carried out. From the results, obstacle which refers to cylinder cap with two perforated plates had successfully increased the FAME production (g). The effects of methanol flow rate and reaction temperature between the range of 1 â€“ 4 mL/min and 260 â€“ 290 Â°C, respectively on FAME yield (%), FAME production (g) and FAME production rate (g/min) was studied accordingly at a constant oil volume of 100 mL. Results showed that higher methanol flow rate and reaction temperature can increase the FAME yield and production. Subsequently, mathematical modelling of semi-batch SMV system, incorporating both reversible transesterification and esterification was developed and verified by using ODE45 solver. The highest activation energy of 50 kJ/mol and the low reaction rate constant of 1.62Ã—10-4 dm3/mol min corroborated that the reaction of TG to become DG as the rate limiting step in SMV system.

Frustules As Core Material For Lysozyme Recognition.', 'Molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) is a robust and cost-effective recognition material with the potential to replace antibody and enzyme. Conventionally, MIP prepared via bulk imprinting method usually showed poor binding site accessibility for targeted protein molecules. To overcome this drawback, significant amount of research works have been carried out using nanoparticles as core material for protein imprinting. This method has improved the template accessibility as well as rebinding kinetics, but the rebinding capacity achieved is still relatively low owing to the polymer layer generated is extremely thin which was not able to encapsulate the entire protein and the recognition cavities generated therein is limited. Hence, diatom frustules with higher surface were used as replacement of core material for MIP in order to improve rebinding capacity. In this regard, Navicula sp. frustules were used for the first time as core material due to their unique properties of good mechanical strength, nanostructure pores, biocompatible, reproducible with exactness in massive number, and easy to functionalize in order to address the limitation of nanomaterials. In this study, the MIP layer was synthesized on Navicula sp. frustules using acrylamide (AAM), methacrylic acid (MAA), and 2-dimethylamino ethylmethacrylate (DMAEMA) as functional monomers. Lysozyme (LYZ) was used as template to be imprinted as it acts as important index in the diagnosis of various diseases. The polymerization conditions were examined and the optimal conditions were attained at percentage of crosslinker of 50 wt % and monomers molar ratio AAM/MAA/DMAEMA of 1/0.5/0.5. Based on rebinding result, this optimal MIP exhibited enhancement in both rebinding capacity (124 Â± 1.09 mg gâˆ’1) and imprinting factor (2.99) with a rapid rebinding kinetic (15 minutes) when compared to other researchers that use nanoparticle core material. The result also demonstrated that affinity of MIP towards LYZ is 2.32 times higher than Cyt C and 8.87 times higher than BSA. This confirmed that conformation and configuration of recognition cavities created in MIP matches with template LYZ. The MIP could also be regenerated and reused at least 5 repeated cycles via mild washing with 0.5 M NaCl which suggested that LYZ interact non-covalently with MIP. This protein-MIP interaction was further investigated by extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) analysis which indicated that van der Waals, electrostatic and steric interactions played dominant role in dictating the adsorption of protein on MIP. The predicted attractive interaction of less than -1.693 kT suggested that LYZ adsorption onto MIP is generally weak and could be disrupted easily. Apart from these, the practicability of MIP to rebind LYZ in protein mixture solution was also performed. The test demonstrated that MIP is able to discriminate LYZ from competing proteins when exposed to various pH solution or solution with high concentration of competing protein. Lastly, the MIP was incorporated with fluorophore (FITC-MIP) to enhance the utility of MIP as potential recognition element for biosensor. The developed FITC-MIP was able to quantify LYZ within concentration range of 0 to 0.025 mg mL-1 with a lower limit of detection of 0.0015 mg mL-1 and a response time within 30 minutes.

Nevertheless, membrane fouling caused by the deposition of fouling materials on the membrane remains a critical issue in many applications of water filtration processes and is the dominant factor that restricts the widespread application of membranes. Thus, this study investigates the efficiency of humic acid (HA) removal by a magnetophoretic actuation composite membrane through magnetic actuation to reduce the membrane fouling propensity. First, the bare magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) were functionalized to increase its colloidal stability, to ensure the homogenous distribution of the MNPs on the membrane surface. Thus, different concentration of water-soluble poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS) were coated around the surface of MNPs, where the optimum PSS/MNPs molar ratio was found at 6:1. Prior to end-capping the functionalized-MNPs (F-MNPs) onto the membrane surface, Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D) technique is used to investigate the interaction affinity between F-MNPs with a specific surface of a membrane. The QCM-D results demonstrated a good interaction between F-MNPs and polyethersulfone (PES) membrane in the presence of polyelectrolytes PSS and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA). Next, the extent of magnetophoretic actuation based on the presence of different concentrations of F-MNPs (e.g., 100, 1000, and 2500 ppm) coated on the membrane surface were also studied. The results shown that the best performance of the magnetophoretic actuation composite membrane was obtained by spin coated the 2500 ppm F-MNPs onto the PSS-PDDA-PES modified membrane surface at the spinning rate of 3000 rpm and 8 s of the spinning time. Subsequently, the influence of pH-fluctuated aqueous mediums toward the stability of the magnetic-responsive functional layer laid on the composite membrane was also being evaluated. Based on the analyses, the best operating pH for the composite membrane were found in the range of pH 2-10. Last but not least, the developed membranes with the best filtration performance were subjected to the fouling mechanisms study, and membrane longevity performance evaluation to reveal the potential of magnetophoretic actuation composite membrane in HA removal. Filtration results indicate a transition of membrane fouling mechanism, from a standard pore blocking to the formation of cake layer throughout the filtration processes but cake fouling was identified as the most critical factor that contributes to the membrane fouling. While for the membrane longevity study, the membrane operated under an external oscillating magnetic field established excellent membrane anti-fouling capability by retaining 96 % of the initial flux (Jo= 9.44Ã—10-6 m3/m2s) after 48 h of filtration with HA rejection of 99.4Â±0.14 %. The enhanced filtration performance was due to the magnetophoretic actuation motions of F-MNPs that reduces concentration polarization near the top surface of the membrane and consequently reduces the potential for membrane fouling.', 'magnetophoretic membranes humic ', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Kimia (School of Chemical Engineering) ', '2016', 0),

First of all, colloidal stability of bare Fe3O4 was successfully enhanced after surface coating with a strong anionic polymer, poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) of molecular weight 70K Da (PSS 70K), through electrostatic-induced post-coating technique conducted at pH ~3.50. Enhanced colloidal stability attained by the resultant PSS 70K/Fe3O4 clusters is mainly contributed from the electrostatic and the steric repulsion, which overwhelm the magnetic dipole-dipole attraction, when the interparticle distance is < 97 nm and < 50 nm, respectively. However, magnetic separation study showed that the more colloidally stable the Fe3O4 is, the harder it is to be magnetically separated. By carefully tracking on the magnetophoresis profiles under magnetic field gradient of average magnitude 40.55 T/m, it was found that bare Fe3O4 attained ~ 100 % separation within 8 minutes; while there was no complete separation for PSS 70K/Fe3O4 clusters even the magnetic separation time was extended to 1 hour. In another words, the polymer coating that was initially employed to electrosterically stabilize the Fe3O4 in turn compromises their magnetic responsiveness. Unlike the bare Fe3O4 which undergo a typical cooperative magnetophoresis, it was found that the PSS 70K/Fe3O4 clusters experienced a size-fractionation based magnetophoresis in which the magnetic separation was controlled by the presence of distribution of hydrodynamic sizes in the suspension. Besides that, microscopic study further revealed the differences between both entities in which PSS 70K/Fe3O4 clusters tend to self-oriented into thread-like structures; while bare Fe3O4 tend to self-aggregate into fractal structures of various dimensions. A simple electrostatic-mediated assembly approach was proposed in this study to produce PSS 70K/Fe3O4 clusters of various sizes (~200 nm up to ~ 700 nm). Here, it was found that PSS 70K/Fe3O4 clusters of average cluster size 459 nm not only possess good colloidal stability, but also offer high magnetic separability (> 98 % separation efficiency was attained when exposed to the same magnetic field gradient for just 5 minutes). This finding indicates that manipulating the cluster sizes of the PSS 70K/Fe3O4 clusters can be used as the solution for the trade-off concern between enhanced colloidal stability and magnetic separability. In the last part of this study, it was revealed that the colloidal stability of PSS 70K/Fe3O4 clusters being deteriorated after addition of metal ions (e.g., Ag+, Cu2+, Cr3+, Ca2+, Mg2+). Results showed that it is the concentration of the metal cation, instead of the conventionally believed ionic strength, plays a more decisive role in enhancing the aggregation process. In addition, with the presence of Cu2+ ion, dissolve organic matters such as humic acid and sodium alginate was found to form complexes with the PSS 70K/Fe3O4 clusters. This formation of complexes can later on influence the colloidal stability and thus magnetophoresis behavior of the PSS 70K/Fe3O4 clusters.', 'magnetophoresis clusters colloidal', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Kimia (School of Chemical Engineering)', '2016', 0),

The improvement was also made on biochemical reaction by considering the deactivation rate of enzyme reaction. The mathematical model allows studying the electric current profile, biomass production, substrate consumption and voltage losses as function of time. The experimental works at different operating conditions were performed to determine the important parameters and validated the mathematical model. Electrochemical methods were applied to perform the electrochemical activity of the system. Polarization curve was used to examine the individual voltage losses such as activation loss, Ohmic loss and concentration loss.

Amine and diamine MS adsorbed more than 30 molecules per nm2 (strong chemisorption interaction) compared to bare MS, CAC and various ACF, which adsorbed less than 10 molecules per nm2 (physisorption). The most important factors which govern adsorption capacity are porosity and suitable surface chemistry, both which are possessed by amine and diamine MS. The flexibility of surface functionalisation of MS is the basis of subsequent uric acid adsorption kinetics test. Amine functionalised MS is hypothesised to improve uric acid adsorption through acid-amine reaction. Uric acid adsorption by MS did not follow theoretical adsorption curve. Further analysis using MATLAB curve fit revealed that MS underwent simultaneous adsorption-desorption, with initial adsorption rates as high as 20.3 mg/g/s compared to commercial silica gel, with initial adsorption rate of 0.39 mg/g/s. As a conclusion, on a whole, MS and ACF performed better than the benchmarked CAC and commercial silica gel in terms of urea and uric acid adsorption.', 'urea adsorption biomaterials', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2016', 0),

In Malaysia, numerous actions have been taken to increase the level of awareness of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) at work. However, various studies have shown that crucial safety and health-related problems are still prevalent. An increase in accidents at work, growing degree of absenteeism, as well as higher levels of sickness and stress at work seem to indicate that even more urgent action is required. Previous studies have also indicated that ergonomics plays a significant role with respect to OSH problems, especially in the manufacturing sector. The implementation of certain initiatives based on ergonomics might provide an avenue for solving, or at least alleviating, safety and health-related problems at work. This, in turn, would ultimately enhance workplace performance. Categorised as a manufacturing sector, the printing industry places high demands on its workers, which brings in OSH problems, and printing industry is yet to effectively implement adequate ergonomics initiatives. Using the concept of Balance Theory, this study examines the role of ergonomic work systems (EWS), as represented by job demand factors, individual factors and participatory ergonomics, in enhancing OSH performance. In addition, psychosocial work factors, which focus on decision authority and social support, were tested as mediators between EWS and OSH performance.

(315, 'Wan Laailatul Hanim Binti Mat Desa ', 'Modelling Bottleneck Factors In A Production Line Using Hybrid Approach.', 'A bottleneck can occur in almost all business organizations, either services or manufacturing operations. In manufacturing sector, bottleneck normally occurs due to repetitive failures in the flow of production system. Besides that, there are several factors that can cause bottleneck events in the production line, such as long waiting time, huge backlog and high stress level. These bottleneck factors can reduce the throughput rate in the production line and negatively affect the production costs. Therefore, it should be tackled for a high production system performance and a smooth flow of products. Because of that, there is a need for the manufacturers to find ways in managing the bottleneck factors. In general, bottlenecks can be caused by tangible and intangible factors. However, the intangible factors have received less attention by the previous researchers. Most previous works had focused on tangible factor such as number of throughput but lack in intangible such as on workers stress level. Thus, this research investigates the intangible factors which emphasizes on human factor particularly in understanding the effect of absenteeism in the production line. In addition, this study also identifies causes of bottleneck in illustrating the relationship between human factors and production line. Absenteeism refers to a situation when the available manpower is less than the number of manpower needed on the production line. This human factor plays an important role in determining the production rate. In this thesis, a hybrid simulation model is used to analyse the absenteeism problem in an aircraft composite manufacturing by integrating a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and a System Dynamics (SD) models which namely as Hybrid Simulation Based Bottleneck Management (HSBBM). To analyse the effect of absenteeism, the amount of throughput, waiting time, work in process (WIP) and cycle time are analysed in various scenarios of production planning. The result shows the number of absentees at production line increase the workload to the available worker and gives effect to the production rate. By considering the absenteeism, the number of throughput decrease 12.67% compared to the production plan indicating that the hybrid model is able to represent more realistic situation when involving human factor. In conclusion, the developed hybrid model can be used to visualise and quantify the impacts of human behaviour that lead to bottlenecks and able to assist the management to generate more relevant production plan.', 'bottleneck production hybrid', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Mekanikal (School of Mechanical Engineering)', '2016', 0),

InnoSAT is a 3U satellite developed by ATSB and five universities in Malaysia. The satellite is developed with limited weight, power, space and budget. The satellite mission is to capture images of Malaysiaâ€™s territory from space. Existing system in the satellite produces unstable dynamic and unbalance of weight. Three axis magnetorquers, sun and magnetic field sensor are installed on satellite body axes. The satellite control torque is produced by perpendicular magnetic field from magnetorquer and Earthâ€™s magnetic field vector which varies periodically in orbit. Three axis Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) gyro is installed as a primary attitude determination and optimal combination of sun and magnetic field sensor as a secondary. Accurate attitude, position and stability of the satellite in orbit while capturing the image is required. This thesis discuss about designing of accurate and fast computation of secondary attitude determination and also attitude stabilization, pointing accuracy, and disturbance rejection control for all satellite position in orbit with existing satellite configuration. The attitude is determined using five methods; TRIAD, QUEST, q-method, FOAM, ESOQ1 and a recursive EKF. The methods are chosen by considering the complexity and possibility to be able to implement in onboard micro-controller of InnoSAT. The point base methods are able to produce accurate and fast output when the satellite out of eclipse but the EKF is able to perform at all position. The q-method shows the fastest and accurate attitude determination compare with other six methods with less than 5% error. The satellite is controlled by inserting sliding mode into satellite model to design controller based on linear Riccati equation; LQR, H2, HÂ¥, m-synthesis and LPV based on Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). The closed loop is analyzed due to variation of weighting functions, uncertainties, and number of feedback at any position in orbit. The controller power consumption is highly considered to see the possibility to implement in existing system. The controller is able to maintain the stability only in small radius position from its design point but if the satellite go beyond the radius the new controller must be recalculated. The continuous stability can be achieved by LPV controller, but the controller unable to maintain stability, pointing accuracy, and disturbance rejection simultaneously at the same time.

This system involved the development of subsurface conceptual model, development of groundwater table fluctuation model, stability assessment and investigation of unsaturated soil behaviour which incorporates the response of pore air pressure. Subsurface characterization of the study area was carried out by using the integration of borehole drilling, electrical resistivity survey and seismic refraction survey. Three dimensional (3D) models of stratigraphy, electrical resistivity and seismic velocity were proven to be effective in identifying the potential failure zone that coincides with the past slope failure zone. The potential failure zone that consist of silt soil was identified to have high water content with electrical resistivity ranges from 10Î©m to 300Î©m and intermediate P-waves velocity (vp) of 500m/s to 1000m/s. Subsequently, the multi tank model and numerical analysis was developed to determine the groundwater table fluctuations and pore water pressure distributions of the slope. The multi tank model was able to produce a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.156 and 0.169 for the calibration model using year 2011 data and prediction model using year 2012 data respectively. The factor of safety (FOS) of the slope throughout the year 2012 varies according to the fluctuations of groundwater table analyzed by using both limit equilibrium method (LEM) and finite element method (FEM). Furthermore, the FOS for the slope model assigned with multi tank model groundwater table produced approximately 1% error compared to the slope model assigned with the observed groundwater table. Therefore, this outcome proven that the developed evaluation system can be utilized as an assessment tool for slope stability forecasting. In addition, the component of pore air pressure which is often neglected in unsaturated soil behaviour during rainfall infiltration was also investigated through one dimensional (1D) soil column numerical simulation and physical modelling. It was found that the development of pore air pressure can be influenced by soil type, rainfall intensity, and initial water content. Both results of numerical simulation and laboratory experiment show that the soil sample from site with rainfall intensity of 26751.6mm/hr and initial water content of 21% produced the maximum pore air pressure. Finer particle size with higher rainfall intensity and initial water content lead to the development of confined pore air as the rainwater cannot replace the pore air smoothly subsequently resulting in pore air pressure build up.', 'development groundwater stability', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Awam (School of Civil Engineering)', '2016', 0),

Since the discovery of graphene in 2004, it has become the main subject of research around the world. The attractiveness of graphene is mainly attributed to its remarkable mechanical, optical, thermal and electrical properties, enabling graphene to be potentially used in various applications. To date, CVD is the promising method to produce wafer-scale graphene, because it allows an easier separation of graphene from the catalytic substrate. With the assist of fast cooling, monolayer graphene was grown directly on polycrystalline Ni foil under atmospheric pressure CVD with temperature of 850 ÂºC, methane partial pressure of 0.2 atm and reaction duration of 5 min. However, monolayer graphene could not be formed on Cu under the chosen CVD conditions. Fast cooling after CVD allowed the quenching of the activity of the catalyst and limiting diffusion of dissolved carbon to the surface of Ni, which later facilitate the formation of predominantly wafer scale monolayer graphene. To further improve the uniformity of monolayer graphene, a facile technique was applied to grow monolayer graphene simultaneously on both polycrystalline Ni and Cu foils using a Ni-Cu bilayer catalyst at temperature of 950 ÂºC, methane partial pressure of 0.2 atm and reaction duration of 5 min. High uniformity and quality of the crystalline structure of the grown graphene was evidenced by Raman spectroscopy mapping and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope. The straightforward bimetallic catalytic system allows the control of carbon diffusion to the interface of Ni and Cu. In particular, carbon accessibility is reduced at the inner Ni surface, and Cu behaves as a carbon barrier. The growth mechanism of monolayer graphene was facilitated by carbon diffusion through the bulk and Ni grain boundary, the driving force coming from concentration gradient between carbon-rich surface to carbon-lacked surface. The grain boundaries were shown to play a crucial role in carbon control during the growth stage. Facilitated by the applied fast cooling, the quenching process reduced the amount of carbon atoms segregated, only the carbon atoms situated near the surface had enough time to segregate and form graphene. Meanwhile, diffusion of carbon atoms at the middle of the Ni foil was highly inhibited; forming Ni3C. Ni3C is known to offer good protection against corrosion. The presence of Ni3C combined with the use of iron nitrate (0.5mol/L) as soft etchant for graphene separation, the Ni foil could be reused again up to 6 cycles without causing a huge deviation on the quality and the uniformity of bilayer graphene. Ni3C is indeed able to limit the etching effect of the Ni foil. This work has successfully demonstrated a simple and novel route to synthesize monolayer graphene with high quality.', 'monolayer nickel reuse', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Kimia (School of Chemical Engineering)', '2016', 0),

In this research, aragonite (CaCO3), calcite (CaCO3), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) and inert materials incorporated calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) were synthesized by hydrothermal, sol-gel assisted hydrothermal and precipitation methods, respectively. Various parameters such as hydrothermal temperature (8 h - 72 h), addition of polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentration (2 M - 10 M), cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) concentration (0.2 M - 0.9 M) and different inert incorporated materials (Mg, Zr, Ce and (Zr-Ce)) on as-synthesized samples were characterized. And then, the CO2 adsorption performances of calcium oxide (CaO) based adsorbents derived from as-synthesized samples were investigated. In the case of hydrothermal method, 1D aragonite (CaCO3) nanorods are observed at 72 h hydrothermal reaction time when PAM is used as an additive, whereas 1D aragonite nanorods are obtained without using PAM at 12 h reaction time. In sol-gel assistance hydrothermal method, 3D calcite (CaCO3) hollow microspheres are attained with 2 M of NaOH concentration, while nanostructured calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is obtained by precipitation method at high CTAB concentration of 0.9 M. On the other hand, Mg, Zr, Ce and (Zr-Ce) incorporated Ca(OH)2 samples exhibit different surface morphologies. The CO2 adsorption capacities of calcium oxide (CaO) derived from 1D aragonite CaCO3 nanorods, 3D calcite CaCO3 hollow microspheres and nanostructured calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 after first cycles are 0.80 g-CO2/g-adsorbent, 0.62 g-CO2/g-adsorbent and 0.71 g-CO2/g-adsorbent, respectively. However, these capacities drop to 0.38 g-CO2/g-adsorbent, 0.39 g-CO2/g-adsorbent and 0.48 g-CO2/g-adsorbent after 10 cycles, respectively. It can be seen that CaO derived from Ca(OH)2 with surface area 64.57 m2/g exhibits the best CO2 adsorption capacity after 10 cycles (0.48 g-CO2/g-adsorbent), but the decay in adsorption capacity with number of cycles is observed. The development of cyclic stability can be observed in CaO-based adsorbents derived from Mg, Zr, Ce and (Zr-Ce) incorporated Ca(OH)2 samples. The CaO-based adsorbent derived from Mg-Ca(OH)2 shows slightly decrease in capacity from 0.67 g-CO2/g-adsorbent after first cycle to 0.57 g-CO2/g-adsorbent after 10 cycles, while CaO-based adsorbents produced from Zr and Ce-incorporated Ca(OH)2 samples exhibit the obvious cyclic stability during 10 cycles, 0.38 g-CO2/g-adsorbent and 0.24 g-CO2/g-adsorbent, respectively. The CaO-based adsorbent derived from (Zr-Ce) acetates incorporated Ca(OH)2 sample increases the capacity from 0.59 g-CO2/g-adsorbent after first cycle to 0.63 g-CO2/g-adsorbent after 10 cycles. The higher adsorption capacity and better cyclic stability during 10 cycles are attributed to the high BET surface area (155.80 m2/g), a wide range of micro/mesopore size distribution (1.7 nm - 30 nm) and the presence of high temperature sintering resistance Ce2Zr3O10 compound.', 'recycled-paper anaerobic reactor', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Awam (School of Civil Engineering)', '2016', 0),

Permintaan yang semakin meningkat dalam penggunaan alamat IP telah mengakibatkan kehabisan alamat IPv4 seperti yang dijangkakan. Untuk menangani kebimbangan ini, IPv6 baru telah dibangunkan untuk menyediakan ruang alamat yang mencukupi. IPv6 dimuatkan dengan protokol baru, iaitu, versi Protokol Mesej Kawalan Internet 6 (ICMPv6), dan protokol baru ini membuka pintu bagi penyerang untuk menyerang rangkaian IPv6. Salah satu jenis serangan yang paling kerap dalam rangkaian IPv6 pada lapisan rangkaian adalah satu serangan banjir ICMPv6 DoS / DDoS. Laporan Arbor Network pada tahun 2014 menunjukkan bahawa ancaman terhadap IPv6 semakin meningkat (72% merupakan kebanjiran trafik/serangan DDoS). Di samping itu, ICMPv6 adalah protokol wajib dalam rangkaian IPv6 tidak seperti dalam IPv4, iaitu ICMP boleh disekat atau diturunkan melalui get laluan lalai. The rapid growth of the Internet in the last few years have exposed the limitation of address space in the current Internet protocol (IP) namely IPv4, due to the increasing consumption of IP addresses. The IPv6 has been developed to provide sufficient address space. It ships with a new protocol. i.e., the Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6), this protocol is a mandatory protocol in IPv6 networks unlike in IPv4, in which ICMP can be blocked or dropped. ICMPv6 opens the door for attackers to attack IPv6 networks. The most frequent types of attack in IPv6 networks at the network layer is an ICMPv6 DDoS flooding attack. One of the main problem in ICMPv6 DDoS flooding attacks is accuracy detection, which suffers from a high false alarm rate. Thus, protecting infrastructure service is a critical issue that urgently needs to be addressed.', 'detection backpropagation network', '', 'Pusat IPv6 Termaju Negara (National Advanced IPv6 Centre of Excellence NAv6)', '2016', 0),

In the present thesis, the rhetorical features of English news headlines and their translation in Persian, through wordplay investigation, using a sample of 200 news headlines (100 English, 100 Persian) are studied. Wordplay is investigated because it leads to the persuasiveness of message that is sometimes so subtle that the readers might not even recognise it. A taxonomy of wordplays is constructed according to Leighâ€™s (1994) model which made it possible to access a comprehensive checklist. The way the persuasive element, i.e. wordplay, is presented for the Persian headline readers is examined using the descriptive method and in light of textual rhetorical analysis.

Objectives : This study aimed to document information about the adequacy of the current Indonesia surveillance system for DHF and factors responsible for high DHF transmission. These will be used for recommending strategies for the prevention and control for DHF in North Sumatera Province. Material and Methods: Five study designs were adopted in this study. In the exploratory study, all key personnels involved in the surveillance system for DHF at the district and health facility levels in the selected six districts were interviewed to determine the function and performance of the surveillance system. The case cohort study recruited a total of 682 respondents with case: subcohort ratio 1:1. Simple and Multiple logistic regression were applied to determine the factors associated with DHF. For the comparative cross sectional study, 688 households both in high and low incidence district were selected using multistage sampling. Simple and Multiple logistic regression were again applied to determine the factors associated with DHF among the households in districts with high incidence. In the entomology study, Independent T test and Two Way Anova were used to determine the effect of larvae positive containers on DHF transmission, whereas for larvae and adult indices Simple and Multiple logistic regression were applied. Theclimatic study utilises monthly a years climatic (2003-2011) secondary data. The relationship between climatic and dengue hemorrhagic fever incidence was determined by Pearson correlation and the impact of climates on DHF incidence by Time series regression. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was then developed to predict the occurrence of DHF. Results : The structure of DHF surveillance system was good but suboptimum with major deficiencies that include unavailability of guidelines, insufficient resources and poor core and supportive functions. Socio-cultural and environmental factors associated with DHF incidence were investigated through caseâ€“cohort and comparative cross sectional studies. Significant factors include experience with DHF in family, travelling history, length of stay, frequency of cleaning water container, frequency of cleaning garbage disposal, education, knowledge, practices in preventive measure, source of drinking water, house style and house with gutter. Aedes larvae and adult indices were above the critical level especially in the high incidence districts with house indices as the predictor for dengue transmission. Climatic factors that include rainfall, rainy days, temperature and relative humidity were significantly associated with DHF incidence. SARIMA model (0,1,1)(0,1,1)12 was able to predict DHF occurrence. Conclusion: The existing surveillance system for DHF need to be strengthened in every aspect. Socio-cultural and environmental factors associated with DHF should be addressed and controlled. Measures should be taken to eliminate or being down the density of Aedes vectors.

In this research, aragonite (CaCO3), calcite (CaCO3), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) and inert materials incorporated calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) were synthesized by hydrothermal, sol-gel assisted hydrothermal and precipitation methods, respectively. Various parameters such as hydrothermal temperature (8 h - 72 h), addition of polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentration (2 M - 10 M), cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) concentration (0.2 M - 0.9 M) and different inert incorporated materials (Mg, Zr, Ce and (Zr-Ce)) on as-synthesized samples were characterized. And then, the CO2 adsorption performances of calcium oxide (CaO) based adsorbents derived from as-synthesized samples were investigated. In the case of hydrothermal method, 1D aragonite (CaCO3) nanorods are observed at 72 h hydrothermal reaction time when PAM is used as an additive, whereas 1D aragonite nanorods are obtained without using PAM at 12 h reaction time. In sol-gel assistance hydrothermal method, 3D calcite (CaCO3) hollow microspheres are attained with 2 M of NaOH concentration, while nanostructured calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is obtained by precipitation method at high CTAB concentration of 0.9 M. On the other hand, Mg, Zr, Ce and (Zr-Ce) incorporated Ca(OH)2 samples exhibit different surface morphologies. The CO2 adsorption capacities of calcium oxide (CaO) derived from 1D aragonite CaCO3 nanorods, 3D calcite CaCO3 hollow microspheres and nanostructured calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 after first cycles are 0.80 g-CO2/g-adsorbent, 0.62 g-CO2/g-adsorbent and 0.71 g-CO2/g-adsorbent, respectively. However, these capacities drop to 0.38 g-CO2/g-adsorbent, 0.39 g-CO2/g-adsorbent and 0.48 g-CO2/g-adsorbent after 10 cycles, respectively. It can be seen that CaO derived from Ca(OH)2 with surface area 64.57 m2/g exhibits the best CO2 adsorption capacity after 10 cycles (0.48 g-CO2/g-adsorbent), but the decay in adsorption capacity with number of cycles is observed. The development of cyclic stability can be observed in CaO-based adsorbents derived from Mg, Zr, Ce and (Zr-Ce) incorporated Ca(OH)2 samples. The CaO-based adsorbent derived from Mg-Ca(OH)2 shows slightly decrease in capacity from 0.67 g-CO2/g-adsorbent after first cycle to 0.57 g-CO2/g-adsorbent after 10 cycles, while CaO-based adsorbents produced from Zr and Ce-incorporated Ca(OH)2 samples exhibit the obvious cyclic stability during 10 cycles, 0.38 g-CO2/g-adsorbent and 0.24 g-CO2/g-adsorbent, respectively. The CaO-based adsorbent derived from (Zr-Ce) acetates incorporated Ca(OH)2 sample increases the capacity from 0.59 g-CO2/g-adsorbent after first cycle to 0.63 g-CO2/g-adsorbent after 10 cycles. The higher adsorption capacity and better cyclic stability during 10 cycles are attributed to the high BET surface area (155.80 m2/g), a wide range of micro/mesopore size distribution (1.7 nm - 30 nm) and the presence of high temperature sintering resistance Ce2Zr3O10 compound.', 'co2 caco3 inert-materials', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2016', 0),

', 'The requirements for better combustion process that emits low emissions can be achieved through porous medium burner (PMB). For that, the porous medium or porous inert media (PIM) installed inside PMB should have better properties. Therefore, the goal of this research is to fabricate PIM from porcelain (tri-axial compositions of kaolin clay, feldspar, and silica) and Al2O3 for PMB using a sponge replication technique (SRT). Inside the PMB, porcelain-PIM was installed as preheater zone, whilst Al2O3-PIM as combustion zone. The emphasized was given to Al2O3-PIM as it involved in combustion process. For the fabrication of PIM, natural (sago and tapioca starch) and synthetic poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were used as the binder for slurry preparation. These binders were diluted and mixed with porcelain and Al2O3, respectively to form slurries. The slurries show pseudo-plastic behaviour, and was used for replication process using polyurethane (PU) sponge template. The replicated template was sintered at 1250 ÂºC and 1600 ÂºC, respectively to yield porcelain- and Al2O3-PIM substrates. The porosity of both substrates is within 79% to 90%. Porcelain- and Al2O3-PIM substrates with natural binders have bulky and finer surface morphology (skeleton strut), but defects (micropores and cracks) were evident compared to PVA added samples. During compressive test, the Al2O3-PIM substrate added with PVA destroyed in fragments, while sample contained natural binder collapsed steadily due to the existing defects. Subsequently, the Al2O3-PIM substrate was dip-coated with SiC-, Ni-, and Cr-based solutions (catalyst materials) and re-sintered at 900 Â°C, 1150 ÂºC, and 1250 ÂºC in vacuum atmosphere. A consolidated coating layer was observed at 1250 ÂºC, which contributed to reduction in micropores, cracks, and open cells. The porosity of dip-coated Al2O3-PIM also dropped significantly. Improvement in compressive strength (from 0.22 MPa to 0.78 MPa) and thermal conductivity (from 0.3446 W/mK 0.5476 W/mK) was observed for dip-coated samples. Finally, the dip-coated Al2O3-PIM was employed as combustion zone inside a prototype PMB. Combustion test was conducted at different fuel inlet. Comparison was made between the plain and dip-coated Al2O3-PIM. Plain Al2O3-PIM substrate shows maximum surface flame temperature of 634 ÂºC, whilst the temperature achieved by SiC-, Ni-, and Cr-coated Al2O3-PIM are 750 ÂºC, 741 ÂºC, and 739 ÂºC, respectively. The improved surface flame temperature for dip-coated samples have reduces CO (from 1300 ppm to 23 ppm) and COu emission (from 1190 ppm to 37 ppm).

(367, 'Thaer Jasim Mohammed', ' Improving Torsional Behaviour Of Reinforced Concrete Beam Strengthened With Ultra High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete.', 'Reinforced concrete members subjected to torsion may fail suddenly due to insufficient transverse steel reinforcing resulting from construction errors, or increased loading due to a change in purpose. Therefore, strengthening and upgrading is the most cost-effective and convenient solution. The proposed techniques to strengthen concrete members such as steel plates, polymers or concrete have important deficiencies in adherence and durability. So, the use of ultra-high performance steel fibre concrete (UHPFC) can effectively resolve these problems. On the other hand, there have been very little studies on the torsional behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) beams with UHPFC composite. This work aims at studying the strengthening of rectangular beams with or without stirrups using UHPFC with different types of configurations and thicknesses to improve the torsional resistance of RC beams. Thereby, an experimental study has been made through this investigation to understand the behaviour of RC beams with UHPFC under torsion. Moreover, simulation of the experimental beams was studied using finite element analysis. The FE method from the ANSYS program is used. Variables considered in the test program include; influence of UHPFC configuration (full, U-jacked and left-right sides), influence of UHPFC layer thickness (10, 15, 20 and 25 mm), and influence of transverse steel reinforcement. Test results are discussed in this research based on torque-twist behaviour, torque-strain curve, influence of UHPFC on cracking and ultimate torque, crack patterns and mode of failure of each beam. Results show that the UHPFC matrix can generally be used as an effective external torsional reinforcement for RC beams with or without stirrups. The UHPFC contribution to torsional strength is increased when thickness increases, for all cases of strengthened beams. Moreover, the UHPFC material can be cast in a thin layer, while sandblasting of the specimen surface ensures good adhesion of the U-jacket without using any primer, which subsequently prevents premature failure of the structure and a significant increase in torque capacity. Despite the positive effect in increasing the torque capacity, left-right wrappingis not the most efficient and economical scheme for strengthening reinforced concrete using UHPFC. The fully wrapped beams exhibited considerably higher torque capacity and torsional behaviour. Therefore, the cracking and maximum torque capacity of the strengthened beams is dependent on both configuration and volumetric ratios of UHPFC. Meanwhile, the FE results show good agreement with the experimental results. The ratio of experimental values of the cracking torque to the predicted valuesfrom the FE results for all beams hasa mean of 1.059 and standard deviation of 0.089.The ratio of experimental values of the maximum torque to the predicted values from the FE results for the beams has a mean of 1.038 and standard deviation of 0.062.It is worth mentioning, the possibility of increasing the durability of the member by applying the UHPFC matrix, due to the reduced crack openings and to the compactness of the UHPFC matrix. Hence, the use of UHPFC appears to be a good method to enhance the torsional performance of RC beams.', 'concrete beam fibre-reinforced', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Awam (School of Civil Engineering)', '2016', 0);

The ALK was prepared by reacting Refined Bleached Deodorized Palm Stearin (RBDPS) with diethanolamine. The unfilled Natural Rubber (NR) and Polychloroprene Rubber (CR) compounds, silica-filled NR compound, and Carbon Black (CB) filled NR, Epoxidised Natural Rubber (ENR-25) and Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) compounds were carried out. In this study, various loading of ALK was incorporated into the rubber compounds which were vulcanised with sulphur accelerated vulcanization system. The main objective is to investigate the effect of ALK loading on properties of the different types of rubber compounds. It was found that ALK could be utilised not only as a curative additive but also as an internal plasticiser in the rubber compounds. The ALK has improved the cure characteristics of the rubber compounds where the increased in cure rates and torque differences were observed. The scorch and cure times of unfilled and silica-filled NR, CB-filled NR, ENR-25 and SBR compounds were shortened as the increased of ALK loadings. The torque difference was increased up to a certain optimum ALK loading of each type of rubber compounds. The ALK also exhibited higher tensile modulus, tensile strength, hardness, resilience and crosslink density, especially up to certain optimum loadings of ALK; 0.6 and 5.0 phr for unfilled and silica-filled NR compounds, respectively; 5.0 phr for CB-filled NR and SBR compounds, and 1.0 phr for CB-filled ENR-25 compound. Study on reinforcement effects of CB and silica on the rubbers showed that the higher mechanical properties of silica-filled NR compound, and CB-filled NR, ENR-25, SBR compounds were achieved. These were attributed from a better dispersion and stronger rubber â€“ filler interaction as well as the cure enhancement phenomenon due to the functions of ALK as a plasticiser and accelerator in the filled rubber compounds. The infrared spectroscopic study on unfilled CR and silica-filled NR vulcanisates proved that ALK has an ability to form crosslinks with CR molecules through the formation of Câˆ’O chemical bonds; and the formation of Oâˆ’Nâˆ’O coupling bonds proved that ALK has interacted chemically with the silica. The morphology study on the rubber vulcanisates with and without ALK proved that Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs of silica-filled and CB-filled NR compounds, CB-filled ENR-25 and SBR compounds with ALK exhibited a greater matrix tearing line and surface roughness due to better filler dispersion and stronger rubber â€“ filler interaction. The higher elongations at break and lower torques minimum of the vulcanisates of filled and unfilled NR, CB-filled ENR-25 and SBR compounds as the loadings of ALK were increased together with the better filler dispersion proved the function of ALK as an internal plasticiser.', 'alkanolamide additive rubber', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2016', 0),

The main objective of this study is to develop a nitrogen-modified palm shell activated carbon (N-PSAC) via microwave (MW) heating method for H2S removal from simulated POME biogas. A preliminary study on choosing preferable method of producing high performance of sorbent was done and MW heating method was selected compared to conventional heating method. The preparation of a high quality of N-PSAC sorbent was done under MW heating variables; 900 Â°C of MW heating temperature, 400 ml/min of N2 flow rate, 10 minute of MW heating time and 3 g of sample amount. MW heating method provides better incorporation of nitrogen functional groups in the N-PSAC carbonâ€™s matrix and well-developed surface and porous structures are believed to be predominant factors that contribute in high H2S sorption capacity. The details characterizations of the N-PSAC sorbent before and after H2S sorption concluded that both physical and chemical sorptions were taken place during the sorption process. A complete breakthrough analysis of various operating conditions namely relative humidity, operating temperature, amount of sorbent, biogas feed flow rate and H2S feed concentration were influencing the sorption capacity of H2S onto N-PSAC sorbent. It can be concluded that the existing settings in Felda Besout palm oil mill (i.e. 35 Â°C, 45% RH and 3000 ppm H2S) are favorable for H2S sorption by using the N-PSAC sorbent without altering the operating parameters. The MW dry-regeneration method is proven to regenerate H2S saturated N-PSAC sorbent up to 100% regeneration efficiency and was tested for 20 regeneration cycles.

Previous studies have shown the interaction between CTCF and YB-1 occurred at the Zinc finger (ZF) and Cold Shock Domain (CSD) respectively whereas the interaction between CTCF and RNA Pol II occurred at the C-terminal domains (CTD) for both proteins. The objectives of this study are to determine the interaction between CTCF and YB-1 in Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (RGBM) cell line and to identify the motif within CTCF CTD that is critical for binding with RNA Pol II CTD. CTCF truncated proteins were produced and used to map the interaction to YB-1 in RGBM cell line. The interaction of these truncated proteins was mapped using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and pulldown assay and the functional significant of the interaction was characterized via mammalian two hybrid system. On the other hand, CTCF and RNA Poll II interactionswere characterized by identifying two sites within CTCF C-terminal domain important for the interaction and seven candidates CTCF C mutant variants named 1A, 1B, 1A1B, 2A, 2B, 2A2B and CM deficient for binding with Poll II CTD were produced. The interaction of these mutants to Poll II CTD was characterized via Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and pull-down assay, while the ability of these mutants to induce apoptosis in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (RGBM) cell line was also analysed using Caspase 3/7 Glo assay. From the results obtained for CTCF and YB-1 interactions, the co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) showed that CTCF was able to form a complex with YB-1 in the RGBM total cell lysate. From pull down assay results, CTCFZF was the only domain binds with YB-1 Cold Shock Domain (CSD) and the rest of domains fail to interact. As for CTCF and RNA Pol II interactions, the Co-IP results shown positive interaction for CTCF wild-type and all the mutant variants in RGBM cell line.

The effects of CTCF C mutant variants on cell death by apoptosis assay showed that CTCF complete mutant (CM) induced highest apoptosis percentage in the cell as compared to the wild-type CTCF. As conclusion, CTCF ZF domain was found to interact with YB-1 CSD in RGBM cell line and the important motif in CTCF C terminal region critical for Poll II CTD binding was successfully identified.

The effects of different combustion and pyrolysis temperatures on the prepared ACFs were analysed. In addition, the effect of acid treatment on EFB fibres was further studied by switching the sequence of acid treatment before and after combustion and pyrolysis. Intercalation and exfoliation reactions on the acid-treated EFB fibre due to sulphuric acid resulted in a higher thermal degradation rate compared to raw EFB fibre without acid treatment. The highest BET surface area and total pore volume obtained amongst the ACF samples treated with acidwas found to achievevalues as high as 1049 m2/g and 0.45 cm3/g, respectively, after optimisation of the processing parameter.

In this study, the main research focus is on the design and development of hybrid models, combining the supervised Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural network and Reinforcement Learning (RL) models for pattern classification. Specifically, the Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) network and Q-learning are adopted as the backbone for designing and developing the hybrid models. A new QFAM model is first introduced to improve the classification performance of FAM network. A pruning strategy is incorporated to reduce the complexity of QFAM. To overcome the opaqueness issue, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to extract fuzzy if-then rules from QFAM. The resulting model, i.e. QFAM-GA, is able to provide predictions with explanations using only a few antecedents. To further improve the robustness of QFAM-based models, the notion of multi agent systems is employed. As a result, an agent-based QFAM ensemble model with a new trust measurement and negotiation method is proposed. A variety of benchmark problems are used for evaluation of individual and ensemble QFAM-based models.

In formal language theory, one of the main studies is on the language generating capability of the grammars, referred to as the generative capacity, which depends on the types of rules. Also a standard technique to increase the generative capacity is to endow the rules with additional features.

Although TiO2 is a widely used catalyst support, its poor visible light absorption and high recombination of charge carriers remains a major challenge for its application. Hence, this work aims to develop carbon (C) incorporated TiO2 NT and carbon phosphorus (CP)incorporated TiO2 NT for photocatalytic decolorization of methyl orange (MO) dye. The formation of C-TiO2 NT by anodization was successful in fluorinated organic electrolyte. Glycerol and ethylene glycol (EG) were the organic electrolyte with their neutral pH. The properties including morphology and structural of the nanotubular oxide formed were investigated. During anodization, the main factors effecting nanotubular structures are types of electrolyte, its composition, anodization voltage applied to anode and anodization time.C-TiO2 NT arrays were rapidly grown in EG containing 0.89 wt% of water (H2O) and 0.66 wt% of ammonium fluoride (NH4F). The optimized rate of formation was 308 nm/min. The incorporation of C into TiO2 NT induced the formation of a new state above valence band (VB), which is attributed to the C 2p state of the interstitial carbon, as well as new state below the conduction band (CB), corresponding to antibonding Câ€“O state produced due to the formation of oxygen vacancies.C-TiO2 NT arrays annealed at 500 Â°C with average pore size of 95 nm, wall thickness of 18 nm and length of 18.5 ï­m, with high aspect ratio (141.2) and surface area (1025.6 m2g-1) exhibited decolorization of about 39% under visible light illumination with rate constant of k = 5.9 x 10-3 min-1as compared to TiO2 nanoparticle of 25 nm which possessed 11% decolorization. In order to improve further the photocatalytic activity of C-TiO2 NT, incorporation of P into C-TiO2 NT was done via anodization of Ti in EG containing 1 M phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and wet impregnation in H3PO4.

However, the conventional coagulants utilized in this process may adversely impact the environment because most are chemical-based and not environmentally friendly. Hence, the production of an environmentally friendly coagulant is necessary to achieve sustainable development. The use of extracts from Diplazium esculentum leaves as coagulant and coagulant aid has not been discussed in literature. In this research, the capability of extracts from D. esculentum leaves, namely, D. esculentum aqueous (DEaqs) and D. esculentum powder (DEpowd), to act as coagulant and coagulant aid in combination with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) was evaluated using stabilized leachate from the Kuala Sepetang Landfill Site (KSLS) and the Kulim Landfill Site (KLS) through a jar test. This research also examined its chemical characteristics (i.e., isoelectric point, molecular weight, Fourier Transform Infrared, and elemental analysis). Identified as polymers with high molecular weight, DEaqs (221 kDa) and DEpowd (275 kDa) act as anionic coagulants and are capable of promoting the coagulation process in leachate saturated with negative particles. The main functional groups that induce the coagulationâ€“flocculation process by DEaqs and DEpowd are carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amine groups, which all contain hydrogen in their molecules. Jar test results were analyzed based on the coagulation activity and removal efficiency (RE) of suspended solids (SS), turbidity, colour, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and ammonia-N. Operating conditions during coagulationâ€“flocculation, floc strength, and sediment percentage characteristics were also studied. Results indicated that 200 mg/L DEaqs at pH 12 in KLS leachates showed the highest removal with 94%, 92%, and 43% of SS, turbidity, and ammonia-N, respectively compares to PACI . In addition, at 1000 mg/L and pH 10, DEaqs yielded the highest removal for ammonia-N (69%) compared to PACl (38%) in KSLS leachates. A 50% reduction in the volume of PACl from its optimum dosage, with the DEaqs and DEpowd dosages below 1000 mg/L, exhibited a synergic effect of all the measured parameters in KSLS leachates. Flocs formed by 1000 mg/L PACl in conjunction with 500 mg/L DEaqs also displayed better shear resistance with a higher strength factor of 121, which was significantly higher than the factor of 86 for PACl alone.

Various treatment methods are available and choosing the most suitable means depends on the characteristics of the leachate. One of the most commonly adopted method is by using a coagulation process. Application of coagulation-flocculation in reducing pollutant from leachate was proven to be effective. However the use of chemical coagulant will indirectly affect the health of living organisms, thus to reduce the effect, substituting the chemical coagulant with natural material (tapioca flour (TF)) can be adapted. A combination of chemical and natural coagulant as a composite coagulant is able to simplify the process and offer many benefits. Instead of using iron chloride (IC), prehydrolyzed of iron chloride (PHI) was chosen as it offers more advantages than those offered by iron chloride alone. The aim of this study is to investigate the capability of composite coagulant made from prehydrolyzed iron and tapioca flour (PHITF) on partially stabilized leachate in a coagulation/flocculation process. The performance of this combination in removing suspended solids (SS), colour, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and ammonia were investigated. Partially stabilized leachate from Matang landfill (MLS) and Kuala Sembeling landfill (KSLS) were used in this study. PHITF, PHI, PHI+TF, TF and IC were tested separately for to compare their performances. The optimization process of PHITF for pH and dose has been carried out based on conventional and response surface methodology (RSM) methods. Through a jar test, the best basicity of PHI was 0.1 and the best PHITF weight to weight (w/w) ratio was 0.7. PHITF (0.7) is characterized as acidic (pH 1.34), low conductivity (0.291 Î¼S/m), high molecular weight (11600 KDa) and low charge density (0.245 mV). At optimum condition (dose=0.2 g/L Fe and pH=4.71) of PHITF, the removals were 94.7% for SS, 91.3% for colour, 48.7% for COD, and 6.6% for ammonia. An optimization by using RSM revealed that the performance of PHITF was at par with that of PHI, PHI+TF and IC especially on SS, colour, and COD removals. PHITF reduced 64% usage of dose from IC dose. The formation of floc and sludge of PHITF is through particle bridging and charge neutralization.. Thus, resulted in better floc and sludge formation of PHITF compared to those resulted from PHI, PHI+TF (dual coagulant) and IC (iron chloride). Application of PHITF on leachate for different landfills (KSLS) has resulted in 96%, 91%, 69% and 4% removals for SS, colour, COD, and ammonia respectively. This indicate the applicability of PHITF for the treatment of leachate from different sites of landfill. Based on the study, it can be concluded that PHITF can be a potential coagulant for the treatment of partially stabilized leachate.\r\n\r\n', 'andfill coagulant tapioca', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Awam (School of Civil Engineering)', '2015', 0),

Comparatively, the sorbent produce in ethanol/DIW have highest surface area (30.45 m2/g), high pore volume (0.235 cm3/g) and small pore diameter (3.8 nm) than DMF/DIW which have surface area (20.66 m2/g), pore volume (0.111 cm3/g) and pore diameter (19.02 nm). The time of reaction determines the formation of homogeneous structure while temperature determines the solubility of the calcium ions. The adsorption capacity was 60% (16 mmol CO2/sorbent) subsequently reduced to 35% (8 mmol CO2/g sorbent) after 10 cyclic carbonation. This is due to sintering problem. However, the addition of MgO in the range of 5 to 30 wt% have improves the microstructure whereby demonstrated less sintering effect with high structural stability. The 5 and 10 wt% of MgO added CaO exhibited high specific surface areas and enhanced the sintering-resistant over multiple cycles for CO2 adsorption. Most importantly, 10 wt% MgO added CaO sorbent showed constant CO2 adsorption capacity (50%) over 10 carbonation cycles. Without MgO addition, the CO2 capacity of pure CaO decreases by 35 wt% but with 10 wt% MgO remained constant. In summary, the results of this research showed 10 wt% MgO is sufficient to form sorbents with high surface area with good structural stability for enhanced cyclic CO2 adsorption capacity.', 'calsium magnesium carbon', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2015', 0),

', 'Environmental problems associated with the use of typical plastics or so called synthetic polymers have direct to the utilization of biodegradable polymer and natural fiber for producing a degradable composite. The efforts currently are underway in producing such composites with the use of thermoplastic sago starch (TPSS) and kenaf core fillers (KCF) in the low density polyethylene (LDPE). In this work, the effect of blend ratio, treatment of natural filler and hybridization with inorganic mineral fillers on the mechanical, physical, thermal and biodegradability properties of composites were studied. Firstly, the LDPE/TPSS/KCF composites containing 0-40 wt. % of TPSS and 0-40 phr KCF were prepared by using melt-blended mixing and compression molding method. The addition of 10 wt. % of TPSS as well as 10 phr KCF had resulted the highest tensile strength. Chemical similarity of TPSS and KCF formed hydrogen bonding as shown in IR spectra and such interaction indicated better interfacial adhesion detected by SEM morphology. As such, the addition of both TPSS and KCF showed an improvement in thermal and has boosted up the water absorption percentages due to their hydrophilic nature. The deteriorating impact of composites due to exposure to natural weathering can be seen with the collapse of overall tensile properties upon addition of TPSS and KCF. The IR spectra is further confirming the photo-degradation occurred with the appearance of carbonyl (C=O) peaks. Likewise, tensile properties, FTIR, SEM and weight loss of soil burial samples also proved the degradation activities over a predetermined time. Next, the effects of graft copolymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) onto KCF as well as their loading on the composites were examined. Grafted KCF is found to be a promising reinforcement to augment the tensile strength, particularly at 10 phr loading and this is evidenced by the adhesion of matrices onto the filler surface in SEM morphology. This is further confirmed by FTIR results whereby grafted KCF formed ester carbonyl groups which are assumed to provide linkage between filler and matrix.Subsequently, the tensile properties of composites with grafted KCF are somehow slightly retained upon exposure to weathering. However, they are still susceptible to degradation due to the presence of monomer and it is verified by FTIR, SEM and weight loss. Lastly, the influences of inorganic mineral filler (halloysite clay) incorporation into the composites at various loadings (3-15 phr) were evaluated. Addition of filler raised the tensile strength up to 12 phr loading. When the filler is loaded beyond 12 phr, the strength tended to decline. Correspondingly, the composites became thermally stable upon inclusion of this silicate fillers. Upon weathering, composite samples with halloysite results a progressive decay in tensile properties compared to the control samples. Similar tendency was obtained from soil burial samples. The severity of deterioration upon degradation was confirmed by the formation of the larger pores and cracks as well as greater weight loss.', 'biodegradability polythylenethermoplastic biocomposites', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2015', 0),

(413, 'Tan Inn Shi', 'The Production Of Third-Generation Bioethanol From Eucheuma Cottonii Using Dowex (TM) DR-G8.', 'The red macroalgae, Eucheuma cottonii (EC) is a third-generation biomass, and it contains large amount of carbohydrate that can be readily fermented into bioethanol. Up to now, the use of the liquid acid-catalyst have been reported for the hydrolysis of carbohydrates from various biomass to fermentable sugar. However, the need of easily separable and reusable solid acid catalyst is considered essential in the hydrolysis process. In this study, for the first time, Dowex (TM) Dr-G8 was explored as a potential solid catalyst to hydrolyze carbohydrates from dried raw EC or macroalgae extract (ME) and pretreatment of macroalgae cellulosic residue (MCR), to simple reducing sugar prior to the fermentation process. The reaction condition for hydrolysis of EC (6 % w/v Dowex (TM) Dr-G8, 120 ÂºC, 1 h) and ME (8 % w/v Dowex (TM) Dr-G8, 120 ÂºC, 1 h) resulted to a galactose yield of 43.2 % and 49.4 %, respectively. This result was slightly lower compared with the feedstock by using ME. However as for MCR, the solid acid catalyst (Dowex (TM) Dr-G8) was used in the pretreatment process to enhance enzymatic conversion of MCR to reducing sugar. Reusability of Dowex (TM) Dr-G8 was also investigated in this study, the galactose yield maintained at around 46.7 % till the fifth run. This shows that Dowex (TM) Dr- G8 was not significantly deactivated even after repeated used. The pretreatment condition for MCR is 10 % (w/v) Dowex (TM)-Dr G8, 120 oC, and 30 min. An optimum sugar yield of 99.8 % was attained when pretreated MCR (P-MCR) was used as substrate for enzymatic hydrolysis after 30 h. Catalyst recyclability study were performed and a sixth-times reuse was accomplished without any loss of catalytic activity. In addition, a novel concept for the synthesis of stable polymer hybrid matrix was developed. In this study, glutaraldehyde crosslinked Îº-carrageenan was used for the immobilization of Î²-glucosidase using the covalent method via polyethyleneimine and glutaraldehyde. The immobilized Î²-glucosidase was then used to hydrolyze PMCR for the production of reducing sugar and a hydrolysis yield of 73.4% was obtained. When a solid acid hydrolysate containing 35 g/L of galactose were fermented with an inoculums amount of 16.0 g/L, an optimum bioethanol production of 11.63 g/L was achieved (64.6 % of the theoretical value) after 72 h. Bioethanol production by PSSF (prehydrolysis and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation) process was observed to be more effective than the SHF (separate hydrolysis and fermentation) process, producing 5.80 mg/mL of bioethanol, with a theoretical yield of 91 %. Scale up of SHF of solid acid hydrolysate was carried out in a 5 L fermenter resulting to 61.6 % of bioethanol yield, while scale up study of PSSF process was carried out in a 5 L fermenter conducted with optimized conditions resulting to 87.1 % of bioethanol yield, which is almost the same as in shaking flasks. This result indicated that the fermentation process using macroalgae biomass could be easily scaled-up to large fermenter without compromising its performance. On the other hand, the estimated bioethanol production cost using macroalgae was 0.77 USD $/L. Compared to other feedstocks, bioethanol production cost from macroalgae are competitive and economically viable. A consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) and exergy analysis of macroalgae-based bioethanol were performed. Results suggested that the purification of bioethanol (S6) is found to have the highest impact in all the impact categories considered. The proposed technology in this study using solid acid catalyst was found feasible for the production of bioethanol from EC.', 'bioethanol eucheuma-cottoni dowex', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Kimia (School of Chemical Engineering) >', '2015', 0),
(414, 'Tham Wei Ling', 'Preparation And Properties Of Poly (Lactic Acid) Halloysite Nanotube Nanocomposites', 'In this research, halloysite nanotube (HNT) was used to improve the properties of poly(lactic acid) (PLA). The PLA/HNT nanocomposites were prepared using melt compounding followed by compression molding. Three types of impact modifiers i.e., maleic anhydride grafted styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene copolymer (SEBS-g- MA), N,Nâ€™-ethylenebis(stearamide) (EBS), and epoxidized natural rubber (ENR), were used to toughen the PLA nanocomposites. The properties of PLA/HNT nanocomposites were characterized by mechanical tests (i.e., tensile, flexural, and impact tests), thermal analysis (i.e., differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)), morphological analysis (i.e., field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The impact strength of PLA/HNT nanocomposites was increased significantly to approximately 300% by the addition of 15 wt% ENR. A finely dispersed HNT could eventually increase its nucleation effect and assist in the crystallization process of PLA whilst in the presence of EBS and ENR. Nevertheless, the presence of SEBS-g-MA and HNT retard the formation of large crystallites of PLA. The kinetics of water absorption of PLA/HNT nanocomposite fitted Fickian diffusion behaviour at immersion temperatures of 30oC and 40oC. For the samples exposed to 50oC, the water uptake followed Fick\'s law during the initial stages, but at longer time periods, deviations and weight loss were observed. This may have been due to the hydrolysis of PLA at higher immersion temperatures, which was confirmed by the pH change, reduction of molecular weight, increase in carbonyl index (CI) values, and thermal property changes. From the TGA results, it was found that single decomposition took place in the nitrogen atmosphere, while a double-stage decomposition process occurred in the oxygen atmosphere. The incorporation of EBS and ENR could improve the thermal stability of PLA/HNT under oxygen atmosphere. The PLA/HNT6/ENR5 nanocomposites exhibited high thermo-oxidative stability under oxygen atmosphere. Furthermore, the addition of 5 wt% of ENR in PLA/HNT6 nanocomposites increased the oxidation onset temperature (OOT) (from 239.5oC to 296.5oC). The PLA/HNT6/ENR5 showed the lowest oxygen permeability coefficient ( O2 P ) value of approximately 1.567x10-4 cm3.m.m-2.day-1.kPa-1. However, the incorporation of SEBS-g-MA could not improve the oxygen gas barrier properties of PLA/HNT nanocomposites. From the UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis, the incorporation of impact modifiers in PLA/HNT nanocomposites decreases light transmittance and nearly no UV light can be transmitted through thin film at 300 nm. Nevertheless, all PLA/HNT nanocomposites remain transparent from visual view. In summary, the addition of ENR in PLA/HNT nanocomposites can effectively improve the properties of polymer nanocomposites in term of impact strength, activation energy of water diffusion (Ea), OOT, and oxygen gas barrier properties among the others impact modifiers.', 'preparation properties lactic-acid', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2015', 0),

It is a cost effective technology that can improve mixture workability, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and is environmental friendly.

In this research, Cecabase warm mix additive was used to lower the production temperature and enhance the asphalt binder adhesion properties with aggregate. Two binders, PG-64 and PG-76, were used to prepare the test specimens. As a surfactant and when blended with asphalt binder, Cecabase promotes adhesion at the binder-aggregate interface. Therefore, the overall laboratory test results showed that addition of Cecabase had no significant effects on binder rheology and optimum binder content. A novel approach using image analysis was used to measure the asphalt mixture adhesion failure susceptibility due to moisture damage. The results showed that adhesion failure increased with the number of freeze and thaw cycles and mixtures prepared with PG-76 binder exhibited lower adhesion failure compared to PG-64 binder.

The measurement of the operational deflection shapes of the brake shoes during drum brake squeal, which was in the torsional mode, was similar to that of the modes obtained from the experimental modal analysis of the brake shoe under the in-contact static condition. A two-degree-of-freedom model was developed on the basis of the experimental modal analysis data within the limited bandwidth of the squeal frequency of 1850 Hz. In this work, the operational deflection shape was used for determination of a structural dynamic modification to be carried out on the brake shoes in order to maximize the damping of the torsional mode as a way to improve the stability of the system. The lumped parameter model was then used to assess the effect of the structural dynamic modification on the squeal based on the transient analysis, which showed a similar trend and can assist brake designers in evaluating the critical parameter to obtain a squeal-free drum brake design. The drum brake squeal was further analysed using finite element method. The second part of this study was the dynamic instability of a drum brake system, which consists of a rotating drum and two immobile brake shoes which took into consideration the rotation effect on the complex eigenvalue. The Coriolis force and the centrifugal load represented the effect of the rotation of the drum.

(449, 'Jimoh Kayode Adewole ', 'High Pressure Co2 Separation Using Membranes Membrane Selection and Process Modeling', 'Separation of CO2 from natural gas (NG) has attracted research interest due to increasing demand for energy and the need for more energy efficient and environmental friendly gas purification techniques. Most of the NG is coproduced with CO2 which need to be removed in order to increase its calorific value. Membrane separation is one of the widely used technologies for CO2 removal. However, its market share is still very small as compared to other gas separation processes. This is due to the use of membrane materials with poor separation performance and the use of non-optimum module operating conditions. Systematic optimization of every stage of membrane preparation and high pressure module operation was proposed to solve this problem. One major challenge of high pressure operation is penetrant-induced plasticization phenomenon which is caused by increasing the feed pressure. Commercial polysulfone polymer was modified to optimize its separation performance. High pressure experimental studies and mathematical modeling were performed to evaluate the separation performance of the membrane. To establish the highest possible feed pressure which can be attained during CO2 removal without plasticization, transport properties of the membrane were evaluated using permeation tests at pressure up to 57 bar. Also, dynamic evaluation of membrane performance was performed using timedependent permeation experiments over a period ranging from 5 hours to 1080 hours (45 days) at various pressures between 6 and 57 bar. Mathematical model was developed based on the theory of dual-sorption and the total immobilization models. The optimization for membrane selection was achieved using a multi-objective optimization method while that of module operating conditions was achieved using non-linear programming constraint optimization model and a Golden search algorithm which was implemented using MATLAB. The plasticization pressure of the prepared membrane is 41.07 bar while the permeability and selectivity at this pressure are 5.99 Barrer, and 44.19 respectively. This is equivalent to a 17.65% and 66.39% increase in plasticization pressure and permeability, respectively. However, the membrane lost about 79.65% of its permeability at this pressure while its selectivity increased by 91.13% as compared to the value at 5 bar. The timedependent permeability tests revealed plasticization pressure as possible equilibrium point which can be used as constraint during membrane gas separation process optimization. The mathematical model developed showed an excellent predictive capability for plasticization pressure. It was also shown that membrane materials selection can be efficiently optimized using the multi â€“ objective optimization approach.', 'co2 membranes process', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Kimia (School of Chemical Engineering)', '2015', 0),

The solder joint defects such as cracks, void formation, and incomplete filling of the PCB hole may weaken the PTH solder joint. In the present research, the PTH vertical fill was carried out experimentally by using a newly developed adjustable fountain wave soldering machine (0Â° conveyor angle). A similar PCB and components were assembled by using a conventional wave soldering machine (6Â° conveyor angle). A non-destructive X-ray computed tomographyscanning machine was employed to inspect the vertical fill of each solder joint. On the other hand, the wave soldering process considering thermal-FSI phenomenon was the focus on this research. The thermal-FSI simulation was carried out by using finite volume (FLUENT) and finite element (ABAQUS) based software through the real time coupling technique using Mesh-based parallel Code Coupling Interface (MpCCI) software. It was found that the adjustable fountain wave soldering yielded higher vertical fill (~99.4%) than the conventional wave soldering machine (~90.8%). Apart from that, the simulations were broadening to the parametric studies on various process and design factors such as conveyor angle and PTH geometry (i.e. offset position, shape, diameter,offset angle). The influences of these parameters on the fluid flow distribution, structural displacement, pressure distribution, and stress have been highlighted. Moreover the optimization of PTH connector in the wave soldering process using response surface methodology (RSM) was handled to study the interactive relationship between independent variables to the responses. The optimum geometrical and process parameters for the PCB and PTH connector were characterized by 0.12 mm of PTH offset position, 0.17 mm of PTH diameter, 0o of offset angle and 473.15 K of molten solder temperature. Finally the case study on the effects of PCB configuration during wave soldering was investigated. Five PCB configurations were considered based on the position of the components.

These residues are not fully utilised, in fact, they serve as wastes leading to serious environmental pollution. In this study, it was found that OPT sap contained high glucose concentration (49.08 â€“ 49.16 g/L), and POME contained all essential nutrients required by microorganisms. Therefore, OPT sap was used as carbon source, while POME was utilized as nutrient supplier for fermentation process to produce bioethanol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Process optimization in shake flasks culture using one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method produced bioethanol yield of 0.428 g/g. Response surface methodology (RSM) via face centered central composite design (FCCCD) optimization was also conducted. The highest bioethanol yield was achieved (0.453 g/g) at OPT sap to POME ratio of 63:37, inoculum size 4.3% (v/v), initial pH 8.0, and incubation time 118 hours. Optimization was then carried out in a 2.5 L stirred tank bioreactor. The highest bioethanol yield (0.481 g/g) was attained at 33Â°C, pH 7.0, and agitated at 0.4 m/s impeller tip speed. However, this result might differ if it is to be reduplicated due to heterogeneity of OPT sap and POME as well as variability in Bakerâ€™s yeastâ€™s performance. Therefore, a predictability test was carried out using Monte Carlo algorithm. Results showed that consistence bioethanol yield with this study could be expected if the fluctuation of kinetic model parameters is 2.5% or below. Variability beyond 2.5% could result in high variation of bioethanol yield with relative standard deviation of higher than 5.0%. Therefore, sensitivity analysis was then carried out in order to evaluate the influence of each kinetic model parameter on bioethanol yield. It showed that bioethanol yield highly dependent on the changes of biosolid which represented the yeast growth. Therefore, in order to maximise bioethanol yield, the yeast growth must be carefully monitored. In order to improve bioethanol production, very high gravity (VHG) fermentation was then carried out using concentrated OPT sap and POME. In this study, OPT sap was concentrated using a rotary vacuum evaporator. In addition, evaporation model considering both temperature and pressure was developed and validated.

The characterization of OPA was carried out prior to compounding by using conventional laboratory-sized two roll mills. Morphological study revealed that the OPA particle was irregular with rough surface and porous structure. The two main mineralogical components in OPA were quartz and calcite which elucidated by Energy dispersive X-ray, X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction analysis. Results of the OPA-filled vulcanizates showed that the scorch time and cure time decreased with the incorporation of OPA whereas maximum torque, tensile modulus, and hardness increased. From a reinforcement pointâ€™s perspective, it was worthwhile to note that the tensile strength improved by 16 % when 1 phr OPA was incorporated. When compared to the commercial fillers, this OPA-filled vulcanizate showed comparable strength to the 50 phr carbon black-filled vulcanizate and even higher than silica-filled vulcanizate. Besides, the incorporation of low OPA loading has increased the elongation at break whereas silica and carbon black reduced the elongation at break of the natural rubber vulcanizates. The measurement of rubber-filler interaction and morphological studies of tensile fractured surface of OPA, silica, and carbon black-filled natural rubber vulcanizates supported the result obtained from tensile properties. The thermal stability and retention properties after thermal ageing were notably enhanced with the incorporation of OPA and improved as the OPA loading was increased. xxx Thermogravimetric analysis also denoted the thermal stability was depending on the filler loading, thus higher thermal stability was found for higher loading of filler-filled vulcanizates. Last but not least, the effectiveness of three different pre-treatment methods was carried out in order to further improve the tensile strength of the OPA-filled vulcanizates. The pre-treatment media, i.e. cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and liquid epoxidized natural rubber (LENR) improved the tensile strength of natural rubber vulcanizates. However, other properties such as curing characteristics, elongation at break, hardness, tensile modulus, and swelling resistance were varied depend on the pre-treatment media utilized. Thermal properties of OPA-filled vulcanizates have been affected after CTAB and LENR modification, but the HCl pretreatment method showed no significant effect and behaves almost the same manner as raw OPA-filled vulcanizates.

(486, 'Toh Pey Yi', 'Magnetophoretic Separation Of Microalgae Via Iron Oxide Nanoparticle', 'Harvesting of microalgae biomass is a crucial step in obtaining the microalgae biomass as biofuel feedstock and also to avoid the secondary water pollution caused by the decomposition of microalgae biomass in the water system. Magnetophoretic separation is being recognized as a feasible method to harvest the microalgae. It is performed via attachment of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (IONPs) on the cell surface in order to impart the magnetic property onto the cells and hence enable the subsequent collection of cells by using a permanent magnet. The electrostatic-mediated-attachment mechanism which enables the attachment and detachment of particle-to-microalgal cell is usually done through a series of pH manipulation. However, the need of pH adjustment onto the microalgae culture medium prohibited the use of this technology in large scale application. Therefore,the surface functionalization of IONPs to form positively charged surface functionalized IONPs (SF-IONPs) is carried out in order to overcome the drawback associated with pH manipulation. This study looked into the characterization of the prepared SF-IONPs, the modeling of particle-to-microalgal cell interaction, the separation kinetic in low gradient magnetic separation (LGMS), and its feasibility on water treatment and biofuel production. The colloidally stable positively charged SFIONPs which were prepared via immobilized-on approach promote effective electrostatic attachment of SF-IONPs on the freshwater Chlorella vulgaris. The surface functionalization using poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)was chosen over chitosan since its surface charge are not pH dependent. A high cell separation efficiency of > 97 % was obtained in all range of pH tested and the oil quality from the harvested biomass was not affected. The kinetic study indicated that the cell separation is initiated via particle-to-microalgal cell aggregation during incubation followed by field-induced-aggregation under magnetic field in LGMS with âˆ‡B < 80 T/m. Extended Derjaguin-Landau-Vewey-Overbeek (XDLVO)analysis employed to predict the interaction between SF-IONPs and microalgal cells took into account the van der Waals (vdW), ES and Lewis acid-base (AB) interactions. The ES interaction governed the net interaction between cell and SFIONPs in freshwater media while the AB and vdW interactions play a dominant role in seawater. XDLVO predicted effective attachment of SF-IONPs onto cell surface with a secondary minimum of -3.12 kT, which is in accordance with the experimental result. This gave an insight on the strategy of particle detachment from cell for reuse. In overall, the performance of SF-IONPs is strongly depending on the particle stability, molecular weight (MW) of PDDA, particle concentration, and the microalgae species. The SF-IONPs coated by very low MW PDDA at dosage of 100 g PDDA/g IONPs formed the most colloidally stable suspension and it enabled the separation of C. vulgaris at almost 100 % efficiency with SF-IONPs concentration of â‰¥ 50 mg/L. The light shading effect and cell agglomeration were the main toxic effect of SF-IONPs (PDDAvl) toward the growth of C. vulgaris. This technology was proven effective and cost feasible in fishpond water treatment. A cell separation efficiency of 90 % was achieved and at water treatment cost of USD$0.15/m3 with a dosage of 0.519 g SF-IONPs/g dry biomass under the LGMS.

The raw materials consist of a kaolinitic Laotian clay and an illitic Malaysian clay, mixed with bioresource wastes (kenaf powder, kenaf fiber, banana stem and sugarcane wastes) as the pore-forming agents (PFA). The raw powders, i.e. Laotian clay (LC), Malaysian clay (MC) and bioresource wastes were initially characterized using XRF, XRD and TGA/DSC. The clay ceramic green bodies were fabricated with different types and amounts of bioresource wastes in the clay bodies (10, 20 and 30 wt%). The granulated powder mixtures were pressed hydraulically using a round stainless steel mould 23 mm diameter, under a pressure of 50MPa. It was observed that different types of bioresource waste additions did not create any shaping problems. After drying, the ceramic green bodies were fired at different temperatures (1100, 1125, 1150 and 1175oC) for 3 hours at a heating rate of 5oC/min. The effects of adding these wastes on the properties of the porous clay ceramics were assessed by shrinkage, density, porosity, water absorption, compressive strength, scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and computed tomography (CT) tests. XRD analyses confirmed that the mineralogical composition of the raw clays consisted of quartz and kaolinite as the major minerals in the LC clay, whilst illite and quartz were in the MC clay. Upon firing, the crystalline phases detected were only quartz and mullite. All the four bioresource wastes were successful in producing porous ceramic bodies in both clays but with varying degrees of porosity. This work had succeeded in establishing that the relative effects of the different bioresoure wastes were the same. For example, the sugarcane waste gave the highest porosity at all temperatures and percentages tested. This was followed by kenaf fibre, kenaf powder and banana stem wastes. Correspondingly, property such as density will be the lowest for the sequence of wastes mentioned. It was also established that the microstructural study using computed tomography provided useful additional information on the shape of the pores apart from the 3- dimensional image by FESEM.

A prominent number of TJR devices used in orthopaedic involve articulation between a metallic alloy and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Although this polymer has excellent properties, suitable for TJR bearing materials, the wear particulate produced due to relative motion between components still remains an issue yet to be resolved. This study presents approaches to improve the wear performance of UHMWPE in implant applications by various types of fillers reinforcement. The UHMWPE composites were fabricated by compression moulding with different filler-matrix ratios. These composites were characterized and compared in terms of their mechanical and tribological properties. The filler which delivered the best performances were selected as the filler in the UHMWPE hybrid composites. The tribological properties was investigated using pin-on-disc tester under different loads and sliding speeds. The worn surfaces and transfer films produce after wear test were studied under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This research consists of four parts. The first part was to investigate the effect of surface treatment of ZnO on the mechanical, tribological and antibacterial properties. Two variants of untreated ZnO-reinforced UHMWPE (U-ZPE) and treated ZnO-reinforced UHMWPE (T-ZPE) with aminoproply-triethoxysilane (APTES) were used to compare the improvement of properties. The antibacterial assessments of the composites were tested against two common human body bacteria i.e. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Results have shown that T-ZPE possess higher mechanical and wear properties as compared to U-ZPE. Both U-ZPE and T-ZPE composites showed active inhibition against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria. T-ZPE showed higher percentage inhibition against the tested bacteria. The second part of the research was compared the performances of the micro- and nano-ZnO reinforcement in the UHMWPE composites. The wear properties of nano-ZnO/UHMWPE composites are better than micro-ZnO/UHMWPE. The nano-ZnO/UHMWPE composites impart superior antibacterial properties as compared to micro-ZnO/UHMWPE composites.

As a result, high gain and broadband antennas are part of the solution to establish a concept of wide frequency usage. Pyramidal horn antenna is most widely used as feed in satellite communication and tracking due to suitability for high gain and broadband applications. Generally, pyramidal horn antennas are fed by a coaxial feed transition. However, there is a fundamental limitation on the operating bandwidth (BW) of the coaxial feed transition and is often being considered as narrowband device. This thesis describes the development and analysis of the BW enhancement feeding technique for pyramidal horn antenna using a dielectric resonator (DR) feeder. The hybrid dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) found to be in essence contributing the BW of the design feeder. The combinational effect of two radiators produces multiple resonant frequencies and provides wideband 48.15% of measured -10 dB return loss impedance BW centered at 14.23 GHz, while that of the pyramidal horn with conventional coaxial feed transition is 13.27%. The designed feeder provide an average simulated gain of 16.22 dBi with flexibility in the impedance BW and the far-field radiation characteristics appears to be satisfied within the operating BW. The pyramidal horn improved the gain of the hybrid DRA by 12.34 dBi. The effectiveness of proposed design and preliminary results of the design have shown a potential to exploit the designed feeder to be used in a parabolic antenna for tracking of satellites applications at 10 to 18 GHz. In conclusion this work offers a new, efficient and relatively simple alternative feeding technique configuration for pyramidal horn antenna.', 'bandwidth pyramidal resonator', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraaan Elektrik & Elektronik (School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering', '2013', 0),

ADE can detect security breaches which other forms of security measures unable to uncover. Yet, it still suffers from the problem of generating huge amounts of alerts that are mostly false positives. Each ADE generates a large number of alerts, where some are real and the others are not (i.e. false or redundant alert). Consequently, this increases the ambiguity among the decision makers as they conduct assessments of alerts. In particular, real alerts of ADE are not classified based on the magnitude of the threat they pose. Therefore, it is difficult for the security analyst to identify attacks and take remedial action against their threats, making it necessary to categorize the magnitude of each threat. For this reason, it becomes necessary to categorize the degrees of threat using data mining techniques, especially where huge data are involved. Several reduction and assessment approaches have been proposed to solve these problems; however, they unable to address many other problems related to ADE. This thesis proposes a new framework called A False Alert Reduction and an Alert Score Assessment Framework for Intrusion Alerts. The objectives of using this framework are to reduce the false alerts and to assess such alerts and examine their threat scores. This work aims to provide a full understanding of the network attacks as well as ease the process for the analysts and save their time. Framework is a standalone system that can work online and offline. It combines the following algorithms: the first algorithm is New Alert Reduction (NAR) algorithm to remove the redundancy from the alertâ€™s file and reduce the false positives.\r\n\r\n', 'reduction alert intrusion', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Sains Komputer (School of Computer Sciences)', '2013', 0),

Block Data Transmission Systems (BDTS) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) are considered as efficient techniques for high data rate transmission and found in the coming generation of mobile and wireless technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems. The Exhaustive Search (ES) detector is the optimum. Owing to its high computational load, lattice sphere detection (LSD) technique and its variants had been proposed. For the system designer, the main objective is to achieve an attractive performance-complexity tradeoff. In this research, LSD based detectors are designed for BDTS and Multi-User Detection (MUD) system. LSD searches lattice points in a sphere within a predetermined radius. In LSD, when the initial radius increases, the performance and complexity increased. This research produces exact expression for the sphere radius used in LSD technique which depends on the lattice dimension and average received power. It is well known fact that a small condition number results in a better detection performance. This research aims to reduce the condition number value to its smallest possible using the regularization methods (L1-regularization and L2-regularization), and utilizing special matrices (i.e., Hankel and Toeplitz).

', 'Some facts can be easily inferred subjectively but difficult to prove objectively, thus causing the philosophers who came before Socrates to deviate from logic in interpreting the nature of the physical world around them. The dialectic between subjectivity and objectivity is the force that motivated us to restore the symbolic dimensions of Mesopotamian cultural and architectural products. The most important theoretical presentations of architecture are those that deal with the metaphysical and physical environments, which together form the contemporary cultural identity. The most important dialectics in contemporary architectural society in Mesopotamiaâ€“Iraq are related to the importance of formulating the basis of cultural identity by highlighting the importance of studies that focus on the Mesopotamian cultural environment. No civilization is older than Mesopotamia, and the cultural and architectural products of this society have extended spatially and temporally but are incapable of speaking for themselves, which lends difficulty to understanding the interpretations of the mental expressions that stand behind the material expressions. As a result, a kind of ambiguity exists about the nature of knowledge relative to its origin in terms of the reflection of mental expressions on architectural expressions. This study sets off from a consideration of cultural and architectural products as part of the philosophical perspective. Therefore, the intellectual exploration of the architectural prototype appears to be the abstract level that is connected to mental expressions on one hand and architectural expressions on the other. The inquiry is phenomenologically unknown; thus, a methodological inquiry was applied by based on the path of formation comprising the spirit of the age and the path of abstraction comprising the cultural species. Thus, this study first adopted the structural analysis method considering the nature of the Mesopotamian cultural core to identify the structure of its mental expressions. Such expressions are represented by myth of creation in Mesopotamia, which is based on the structure of origin, evaluation, and organization. Second, this study adopted the geometrical analysis method to determine the structure of the architectural expressions, which are represented by symbolic architecture, temples, and palaces in Mesopotamia based on the structure of the wholeâ€“part, publicâ€“private, and massâ€“void.', 'architectural mesopotamian cultural', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Perumahan, Bangunan & Perancangan (School of Housing, Building & Planning)', '2013', 0);

Besides, gold nanostructure is also a good plasmonic material. However, cobalt is susceptible to oxidation in aqueous environment. The oxidised layer can harm the magnetic properties. Therefore, in order to avoid oxidation of cobalt, this work was devoted to the synthesis of cobalt and cobalt-gold bimetallic hierarchical particles using polyol method cum galvanic replacement reaction. A number of synthesis conditions were experimented in order to investigate their impacts on the morphologies of the cobalt particles produced. The parameters studied including reaction time, sodium hydroxide, concentration of cobalt salt, reaction temperature, reducing agent and surfactants. Various morphologies were successfully prepared such as hierarchical microspheres, hierarchical polyhedral shape, hierarchical raspberry like, truncated hexagonal bipyramid, flower-like, elongated and quasi cubic-like particles. All of these hierarchical cobalt particles exhibited their own unique magnetic properties. Sample prepared from 1mmol cobalt chloride, 2 mmol of sodium hydroxide, 5 mmol of hydrazine hydrate and 3.0% (w/v) of sodium dodecyl sulfate has a mixture of quasi cubic and elongated particles.

The porous Zn anode was prepared by mixing Zn powder and agar binder at different concentrations to achieve the desired conductivity and physical properties. Agar is an abundant natural polymer that does not require tedious and costly processing or preparation. Agar is also a gel-forming environmental friendly material. Meanwhile, the presence of KOH causes the growth of ZnO needle structures to cover the Zn-active material. Zn-agar binder without KOH produced the highest discharge capacity of 505 mAhïƒ—gï€­1. By contrast, the addition of KOH reduced the discharge capacity. The introduction of Super P improved the electrochemical performance of the batteries. The advantages of using Super P in batteries include high purity, large area, and highly structured body. The use of Super P additive in porous Zn anode enhanced the Zn-air battery discharge capacity because of the efficient and better voltage stability obtained from such an anode. The specific discharge capacity and power density of Zn anode with 2 wt% Super P were 776 mAhïƒ—gï€­1 and 20 mWïƒ—cmï€­2, respectively.

The first objective of this research is to examine the level of corporate social disclosures present in 2010 Malaysian construction listed companiesâ€™ annual reports. The second objective, is the application of Ullmannâ€™s (1985) stakeholder framework, which contains three dimensions namely stakeholder power; strategic posture; and economic performance, to determine their ability to explain why these companies disclose voluntarily social and environmental information in their annual reports. Companies without a 2010 annual reports are omitted from the construction companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia to create a sample of 107 companies. Data was collected to measure components of corporate social disclosure, and proxies for Ullmannâ€™s three-dimensional stakeholder framework were applied. This study examines the level of corporate social disclosures in relation to creditor stakeholder power represented by return on equity; investorsâ€™ stakeholder power represented by government shareholders and foreign shareholders and employee stakeholder power represented by employee share ownership. Evidence shows that both creditor and government shareholders (measures investor power), and employee share ownership does empower stakeholder pressure regarding the quantity and quality of corporate social disclosures. In contrast, foreign shareholders were an insignificant proxy and did not serve in explaining the level of corporate social disclosure in the companiesâ€™ annual report. The results also find that companies displaying a more active strategic posture towards social and environmental issues disclose higher quantity and quality of corporate social disclosure information than companies displaying a less active posture to these issues. Companies employ strong corporate governance mechanisms to, strategically, manage their relationship with their stakeholders through disclosing voluntary social and environmental information. The presence of corporate social responsibility committee in the companiesâ€™ board structure is also evidence of strategic posture, but only in quantity of corporate social disclosure. Companies with higher economic performance disclose a greater amount of corporate social disclosure information than, companies with lower economic performance.

The scaling down of IC package size has given challenges to the engineers and IC designers in maintaining package reliability. In moulded underfill (MUF) process, the interaction between fluid (EMC) and structure (silicon chip and solder bump) yields unintended deformation and stress that may cause defects and reduce package reliability. Thus, the understanding of the FSI phenomenon is essential for the engineers and IC designers to tackle these problems. Therefore, the MUF process considering FSI aspect was the focus of this research. The FSI simulation was performed by finite volume based (FLUENT) and finite element based (ABAQUS) software through the MpCCI coupling technique for the simultaneous analysis. The capability of the software in handling encapsulation problems was examined by comparing the predicted results with previous scholarsâ€™ works and the current scaled-up MUF encapsulation processes.

The increasing of I/O counts in a small scale IC chip result in severe wire deformation and deformation issues during transfer moulding process. In this research, visualization of wire sweep phenomenon during the encapsulation process of plastic ball grid array (PBGA) package is studied through a three-dimensional (3D) fluid structure interaction (FSI) technique; which FV- and FE-based software are connected by using mesh-based parallel code coupling interface (MpCCI). The effect of polymer rheology, inlet pressure, arrangement of inlet gate, number of stacked die, wire diameter and size of mould cavity vents, on the melt flow behaviour, wire sweep, filling time, cavity pressure and stress distributions, are mainly studied. A 3D model of mould and wires was created by using GAMBIT, and the fluid/structure interaction was simulated by using FLUENT and ABAQUS software integrated with MpCCI for the real-time calculations. The Castro-Macosko model and Kamal model are used to incorporate the polymer rheology and the Volume of Fluid (VOF) technique is applied for melt front tracking. User-defined functions (UDFs) were incorporated to allow the curing kinetics. However, in the experimental work, the effects of FSI phenomenon in the PBGA package was studied using a scaled-up package size to mimic the encapsulation process. The effects of stacked die, inlet gate arrangement, outlet vent, and inlet pressure of mould cavity on the melt flow behaviour and wire sweep were xxxiii investigated. The constant viscosity of test fluid was utilised for experiment. The numerical results of melt front patterns and wire sweep were compared with the experimental results and it was found in good conformity. Three types of Epoxy Moulding Compound (EMC) were utilized for the study of fluid flow within the mould cavity. The melt front profiles and viscosity versus shear rate for all cases were analysed and presented. The numerical results of melt front behaviour and wire sweep were compared with the previous experimental results and found in good agreement. In the present study, the lower viscosity shows the lower air trap, lower pressure distributions and lower wire deformation. Optimised design of the PBGA gives better PBGA encapsulation process and minimises the wire sweep. The physical and process parameter (i.e., pressure inlet, wire diameter, vent height) were optimised via response surface methodology (RSM) using central composite design (CCD) to minimise the deformation of wire sweep, filling time and void in package during the PBGA encapsulation process. Fluid structure interaction (FSI) was considered in the optimisation of the PBGA encapsulation process. The optimum empirical models were tested and well confirmed with the simulation results. The optimum design of the PBGA with 12 wires for both physical and process parameters ware characterised by 5.57 MPa inlet pressure, 0.05 mm wire diameter, and 0.36 mm vent height.

(572, 'Muhammad Azwadi Bin Sulaiman', 'Effects Of Electrode Materials On Electrical Properties Of Cacu3ti4o12 At 100 Hz â€“ 1 Ghz', 'CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) has attracted much interest because of its extraordinary high dieletric constant of 100,000 at room temperature and very small temperature dependence in a broad temperature range from 100 K to near 400 K. This high dielectric constant offers opportunities in miniaturization of electronic application nowadays. However, CCTO also possesses high dielectric loss which is undesirable in electronic applications. To lower the dielectric loss, it is necessary to understand the origin of polarization responds and relaxation mechanism in CCTO. Using wide frequency impedance spectroscopy (IS) from 100 Hz to 1 GHz, the origins of polarization effect can be revealed. One of the important origins is the used of different electrode materials which determine the contact condition to the bulk CCTO. A research was carried out to study the effect of electrode materials to the electrical properties of CCTO at the frequencies of 100 Hz to 1 GHz. Samples were prepared through solid state reaction methods and starting materials of CaCO3, CuO and TiO2 has been used. After the characterization, the starting materials were mixed for 1 hour and thermal analysis was done. Mixed powder was calcined at 900 to 1000ÂºC for 3 to 6 hours. Phase analyses and microstructure observation was carried out. Calcination at 1000ÂºC for 3 hours produced almost single phase of CCTO. The calcined powder was pressed into pellet forms and the sintering processes were done between 1000 to 1050ÂºC for 3 to 10 hours. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analisys indicated that sintering at 1030ÂºC and below increased the lattice parameter and long soaking time until 10 hours at 1040ÂºC has decreased the lattice parameter. Longer soaking times are also increasing the crystallite size and 6 hours of soaking time or xix more produced large grains (>100Î¼m). The IS reported the dielectric constants and dielectric loss are also increased with the sintering soaking time. Relaxation peak at 10 MHz is suggested due to the loss of grain boundaries polarization effects. High frequency curve of impedance complex was observed and modeled as domain and domain boundary contribution in equivalence circuit analyses. The current-voltage characteristic reported the non-linearity and proved the Schottkyâ€™s barrier of CCTO. Sample sintered at 1040ÂºC for 4 hours have stable and high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss over the frequency range. Heat treatment study to the electrode from room temperature to 400ÂºC in argon gas revealed the increase of dielectric constant with the increasing of treatment temperature. The dielectric constant improvement was due to more Schottkys contact formation after the treatment. Treatment at 300ÂºC is the most suitable temperature to produce high dielectric constant CCTO with low dielectric loss. Schottkyâ€™s effect to the contact were observed by applying different electrode material, gold, platinum, silver and aluminium and non-linear of current-voltage characteristic was revealed on Pt and Au electrode. This is due to both electrodes have higher work function than the other electrodes. Samples with Au electrode showed high dielectric constant at 1 MHz (4,398) and low dielectric loss (0.03 at 1.58 kHz).

Tapioca starch was chosen to incorporate into HDPE/NR blends due to its abundance and biodegradability properties. However certain drawbacks, such as poor compatibility with the hydrophobic polymer matrix, tendency not to disperse during processing and affinity for moisture are factors which lower the potential of TPS based blends. TPS loadings were varied from 0 wt% to 30 wt% and incorporated into HDPE/NR blends using HAAKE rheomix 600 internal mixer. The melt blending was carried out at temperature of 150 â°C with the rotor speed of 50 rpm for 12 minutes. Mechanical properties of blends were evaluated as a function of TPS loadings and the influence of blendâ€™s modification. The tensile strength showed a sharp drop on addition of TPS particle into the blends system due to the inability of TPS to support the stress transfer between phases. Few series of blendâ€™s modification have been done in order to improve the mechanical properties of the blends. TPS was treated with citric acid in order to improve the plasticization and fluidity of TPS in HDPE/NR blends. TPS can be partly depolymerised to produce low viscosity product when processed with citric acid. It is also found that TPS with low molecular weight (Mw) is easy to disperse in the thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) blend and improve wettability at the inter phase of TPS-HDPE/NR as shown by scanning electron microscope (SEM).

The presence of pyrochlore phase was detected in BSmT samples when the content Sm above 0.5. La substituted-BIT (BLaT100) exhibited high Îµr (212) and low tan Î´ (0.005). This is as a result of uniform grain size (1.6 Î¼m in length and 0.3 Î¼m in width) with the improved relative density (91%) of the sample. However, for ferroelectric properties, the maximum Pr (9.6 Î¼C/cm2) with low Ec (18 kV/cm) were observed at BLaT75 and BLaT100 samples, respectively. The best optimum sample for Nd substituted-BIT was BNdT100 with Îµr and tan Î´ values of 231 and 0.005, respectively. The average grain size was 1.3 Î¼m in length and 0.3 Î¼m in width with improved relative density of 90% were achieved in BNdT100 sample. For ferroelectric properties, the maximum Pr (9.2 Î¼C/cm2) with low Ec (34 kV/cm) were identified from BNdT75 and BNdT100 samples, respectively. In BSmT system, the improved dielectric properties were obtained from BSmT100 sample with Îµr and tan Î´ were 139 and 0.004, respectively. The improved dielectric results were attributed to the uniform grain size (1.9 Î¼m in length and 0.4 Î¼m in width). Nevertheless, the low ferroelectric performance in BSmT100 is due to low Pr (4.4 Î¼C/cm2) and high Ec (64.3 kV/cm).', 'rare-earth bismuth combustion', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering) ', '2013', 0),

Several researches on large size mirror in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) scanner were conducted. For instance, research on micromachined polysilicon microscanners has been performed for barcode scanner. However, the curvature of the microscanners causes image distortion. Furthermore, high operation voltages of the MEMS scanner deter the usage of MEMS scanner in hand-held applications. In this research, a linear resonant scanner consisting of an electronically driven mechanically-resonant torsional spring-mirror system was developed for display applications. The scanner was designed according to the functional components such as compliant structure and actuator. The torsional spring which is the compliant structure was modeled with finite element analysis (FEA) and geometry studies were conducted. The optimized torsional spring with the lowest stress level was selected for the design. The actuator of air core coil (ACC) was used in the scanner; geometry study was used to maximize the magnetic forces of the ACC. The ACC of with minimum length, minimum inner radius and maximum outer radius was used. Besides, experimental analysis and FEA of the scanner showed that resonant frequency, angular displacement and stress level are affected by the magnet position on the suspended plate. After the scanner design, several characteristic studies were conducted. A nonlinear damping model is proven to be able to analyze and predict the free vibration response of the scanner based on experimental results. xxx The damping model is able to accommodate the frequency perturbation which happens when the scanner mounting is changed. The hysterical frequency response on the large scale torsional spring mechanism is first found in this research work. Furthermore, the relationship between scanning angle and driving frequency was employed for extra mechanical gain.

However, poor visible-light absorption and high recombination of charge carriers still remain as challenging issues for their practical applications. Hence, the objective of this work was to develop carbon and potassium-incorporated TiO2 nanotube arrays for solar energy harvesting applications, including photodecolorization, photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Visible-light responsive TiO2 nanotube arrays were rapidly grown with a rate of ~289 nm min-1 by anodic oxidation in ethylene glycol (EG) containing 0.5 wt% ammonium fluoride (NH4F) and 1 wt% H2O. The presence of adsorbed-carbonate species and interstitial carbon in TiO2 nanotubes originated from the pyrogenation of EG resulted in the generation of localized state, and thus enabled the visible-light absorption. Anatase TiO2 nanotube arrays with high surface area (ï¾110.9 m2 g-1) were obtained by facile immersion of as-anodized nanotube arrays in hot water at ~90ï‚°C. Such hot water-treated nanotube arrays exhibited efficient visible-light photodegradation of methylene blue with the decomposition rate of ~11 % h-1. This value is relatively higher than heat-treated arrays (~9 % h-1) and P25 powder (~2 % h-1). However, heat treatment at 400ï‚°C for 4 h was found as essential approach to obtain better crystallinity for high PEC and DSSC properties. Heat-treated TiO2 nanotube arrays with average nanotube lengths xxxiv of ï¾18 ï­m, thick walls (ï¾13 nm) and large pore sizes (ï¾115 nm), with high aspect ratio (~123.6) exhibited remarkable ability to generate H2 at a rate of ~508.3 ï­L min-1 cm-2 and photoconversion efficiency (ï¨) of ~2.3%. The growth of TiO2 nanotube arrays and their electrochemical properties were further improved by simple addition of potassium hydroxide (KOH) into fluorinated-EG. The incorporation of 1 wt% of 1.0 M KOH facilitated an equilibrium growth of nanotube arrays with a rate of ~353 nm min-1. The adsorbed-potassium species further extended the light visible-light absorption to ï¾780 nm. Furthermore, the electron donation nature of adsorbed-potassium promoted larger number of charge carriers (9.7 Ã— 1021 cm-3). Carbon and potassium-incorporated TiO2 nanotube arrays with aspect ratio of ï¾140.5 exhibited superior photoelectrochemical H2 generation with an evolution rate of ~658.3 ï­L min-1 cm-2 and ï¨ of ~2.5%, which is ï¾30 % higher than that of without potassium. Carbon and potassium-incorporated TiO2 nanotube arrays were assembled to back-side illumination DSSCs using N719 dye and iodide/triodide redox electrolyte. Well-aligned nanotubes with average nanotube lengths of 18 ï­m, thick walls (ï¾13 nm), and large pore sizes (ï¾130 nm) allowed a greater penetration of excited hï® and ease charge carrier diffusion. Furthermore, high geometric surface area up to ï¾755 could harvest higher dye adsorption. A maximum ï¨ of 2.78% was achieved from a 17.8 ï­m length TiO2 nanotube arrays, with open circuit potential of 0.67V, current density of 8.95 mA cm-2, and filled factor of 46.39%.', 'potassium dioxide solar-energy', '', 'Pusat Pengajian Kejuruteraan Bahan & Sumber Mineral (School of Material & Mineral Resource Engineering)', '2013', 0),

A total of 795 form two (year 8) students (446 low achievers and 349 high achievers) and 72 teachers from five secondary schools in the state of Penang were selected via purposive sampling method to participate in the quantitative part of this study. 10 teachers and 7 students from were taken from the sample in order to participate in the qualitative part of this study. Quantitatively, self-esteem was measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), while Locus of Control was measured by using Internal Control Index (Dutweiller, 1984), and Studentsâ€™ perceived teachersâ€™ expectancy is measured by using Scales of Perceived Teachersâ€™ Expectancy (Prihadi, 2009). Scale of Teachersâ€™ Expectancy was developed in order to collect the data about teachersâ€™ expectancy towards the students. All scales were translated into the Malay language and internal consistency reliability scores (Cronbachâ€™s alpha) were found to be above 0.6 for all scales. Open-ended interviews to the students and teachers were conducted in order to collect the qualitative data. Results showed that students from low-performersâ€™ classes had their internal Locus of Control mediates the influence of their perceived teachersâ€™ expectancy on their self-esteem; in other words, their self-esteem would not be influenced by their perception of teachersâ€™ expectancy if they have internal Locus of Control. However, mediation effect was not shown among high-performer students. This study also discovered that correspondence bias occurred among teachers, which means that teachers developed different expectancy towards high and low achiever students without any further consideration; they expect high-achievers to be willing to improve their achievement and low-achievers are expected to be involved in disciplinary problems. Some meaningful themes emerged during the qualitative data analyses and played their roles in explaining the phenomenon even deeper.

The issue with a bubble build-up is the misallocation of scarce economic resources in speculative activities which crowd out investment in productive activities. When the bubble collapses, its effect is even greater on society as a whole. Researchers nevertheless are still debating its existence even historically, what its causes are, and whether it will has any consequential effects on countries generally and society at large. This study seeks to provide further insight on these three questions. A multi-test approach was employed to determine the existence of bubbles. Using the financial instability hypothesis proposed by Hyman Minsky and a polynomial distributed lag approach; several salient variables were identified to have explanatory properties on the propagation of asset price bubbles in Malaysia and Singapore. In the case of stock price bubbles propagation, both real GDP growth and capital flows are consistently significant explanatory variables. As for real estate bubbles, real interest rates, real GDP growth, and the stock market bubble proxy are leading indicators.

The key objective of the study is to examine how national identity is represented in selected independent films made by four leading independent filmmakers â€“ Abu Sayeed, Tanvir Mokammel, Morshedul Islam and Tareque Masud. Theoretical applications of national identity by Earnest Gellner, Benedict Anderson, Arjun Appadurai, Homi K Bhabha and Stuart Hall and the notion of representation by Stuart Hall are instructive here in guiding this study. For textual analysis of selected films, film narratology derived from the theory of Narrative Discourse by Gerard Gennette has been applied. Also the idea of cultural institution is used to relate to the topic to the larger cultural, historical and societal aspects. The method of the study is qualitative and the measures of the study are in-depth interviews and analyses of film texts. The analyses find the independent filmmakers of Bangladesh try to depict Bengaliness, the ethno-linguistic identity approach, as the preferred identity approach of Bengali Muslims and portray Muslimness, the religious identity and popular religion identity approach, as the â€˜otherâ€™ identity. The findings also suggest that to sustain the ethnic and cultural elements of Bengaliness on the screen, directors do not hesitate to orientalise themselves to the interests of the global audience.

Pendekatan pembangunan baru menggunakan kerjasama daripada pelbagai pihak ke arah mencapai petempatan mapan, yang melibatkan baik pulih fizikal dan pembangunan kapasiti komuniti. Dalam usaha ini, pendekatan sektor swasta menggunakan saluran tanggungjawab korporat sosial (CSR) melalui kerjasama dengan sektor kesukarelawan sebagai kaedah untuk menyampai, mempermudah dan menambah baik pembangunan petempatan.

New development approaches drawing more actorsâ€™ efforts through partnership are sought to promote sustainable human settlements, which include physical upgrading and community capacity building. Private sector involvement through corporate social responsibility (CSR), and the use of voluntary and private sector partnership as a tool to deliver, facilitate and improve the CSR are believed to be the new development approach. These enable diverse, complementary and more resources to be drawn together to give supports to human settlement development. The adoption of the CSR through partnership can bring benefits to all parties, including the served communities and the involved corporations and voluntary organizations (VOs).

In this research, the impact technique is extended to measure the global dynamic properties including the dynamic shear stiffness of the engine mount.. When the engine mount is oriented in certain angles, the combination effect of dynamic compression stiffness and dynamic shear stiffness altered the global dynamic properties of the engine mount. A transformation technique is developed to include both of the dynamic stiffnesses and used them to determine the global dynamic properties of engine mount. Three different types of engine mounts are used to validate the application of the developed technique. Finally, optimization was carried out to demonstrate the effect of the global dynamic properties based on the frequency-dependent properties of engine mount.

(or ketum) for recreational high and as a self-medication alternative to traditional opiates, hence subjecting it to addictive liabilities. Mitragynine (ketum major alkaloid) is an atypical opioid agonist exhibiting complex psychostimulant and morphine-like analgesic effects, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In recent years, studies demonstrated a wide array of overlapping and integrated neuronal circuits in addiction, including the opioid-cannabinoid-glutamate AMPA-neurokinin-dopaminergic systems. This study aimed to demonstrate the involvement of the cannabinoid (CB1), glutamate (GluA1) and neurokinin (NK1) receptors in the hippocampus, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and lateral habenula (LHb) brain regions as the neurobiological bases of ketum abuse potential through its interaction with mitragynine. One hundred and twenty (n=120) male Swiss albino mice were subjected to 28-days (chronic) regimen with untreated and Tween-20 vehicle control, morphine sulphate, THC or mitragynine, either with/without coadministration with CB1, GluA1 or NK1 receptor antagonists (i.e. NIDA-41020, PhTx- 74 or RP-67580, respectively). The IntelliCageÂ® system was used as the behavioural sensitisation setting to assess mice cognitive performances and addiction-like behaviours following chronic drug treatment. Findings revealed that chronic mitragynine exposure (incremental doses of 5 to 25 mg/kg) resulted in hyperlocomotion (p < 0.05), potentiated preference and persistence for natural reward (i.e. 10% sucrose) (p < 0.01), resistance to punishment (p < 0.05), and spatial learning memory deficit (p < 0.05), comparable to those observed in morphine- and THCsensitised mice (p > 0.05). The mitragynine-, morphine- and THC-induced spatial learning and memory impairments were attenuated by NIDA-41020 (p < 0.05), PhTx- 74 (p < 0.05) and RP-67580 (p < 0.05), suggesting the CB1, GluA1 and NK1 receptors putative role in the drugsâ€™ mechanism of actions. The underlying adaptations in mice key brain mesolimbic areas, with regards to CB1, GluA1 and NK1 receptors, were investigated using immunohistochemistry, Western Blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) studies. Mitragynine-sensitised mice demonstrated enhanced CB1 receptor proteins and genes expression at hippocampus CA1 (p < 0.001) and VTA regions (p < 0.001). GluA1 receptor proteins and genes were also up-regulated at hippocampus CA1 regions (p < 0.001), whereas NK1 were up-regulated at the LHb (p < 0.05). These mitragynine-induced receptor up-regulations resembled those observed with chronic morphine (p > 0.05). Neuronal changes as seen in mitragynine- and morphine-sensitised mice appeared to be absent in drug paired with respective receptor antagonist groups, thus providing affirmative clues to the behavioural changes observed. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the seeming integrated role of brain CB1, GluA1 and NK1 receptors in mitragynine/ketum addictive liabilities, leading to behavioural and probable adaptive changes in the brain mesolimbic reward pathway. However, the extent and nature of these receptor interactions in ketum misuse remain unclear. The study findings lend the first correlative relationship that implicates drug molecular targets not previously known (i.e. cannabinoid-glutamate AMPA-neurokinin systems) in relation to chronic mitragynine misuse.

Oleh itu, hotel\r\nmemerlukan pekerja yang produktif dan mampu memenuhi keperluan dan jangkaan\r\npelanggan. Pekerja sedemikian mempamerkan apa yang digelar \"gelagat\r\nke\\varganegaraan orga~isasi\". Memandangkan gelagat kewarganegaraan terutama di\r\nkalangan pekerja yang sentiasa berhadapan dengan pelanggan memberi sumbangan\r\nkepada kecekapan dan keberkesanan hotel, penyiasatan ke atas anteseden gelagat ini\r\nmenjadi penting. Berdasarkan pemahaman mengenai perhubungan pertukaran sosial\r\n(Blau, 1964), norma balas membalas (Gouldner, 1960), dan rantaian kepercayaan-sikapgelagat (Fishbein & Ajzen,l975), kajian ini menghipotesiskan bahawa: (1) kepercayaan\r\npekerja mengenai organisasi (keadilan prosedur dan tanggapan mengenai sokongan\r\norganisasi) akan mempunyai kesan yang langsung ke atas gelagat kewarganegaraan\r\norganisasi mereka, (2) kepercayaan pekerja mengenai organisasi (keadilan prosedur dan\r\ntanggapan mengenai sokongan organisasi) akan mempunyai kesan tidak langsung ke\r\natas gelagat kewarganegaraan mereka melalui sikap mereka terhadap organisasi\r\n(komitmen organisasi), (3) keadilan prosedur akan mempunyai korelasi yang positif\r\ndengan tanggapan mengenai sokongan organisasi. Sejumlah 3 79 pekerja bukan\r\npenyeliaan yang berkhidmat dalam industri perhotelan telah memberikan maklumat\r\nmengenai tanggapan mereka terhadap keadilan dalam proses pembuatan keputusan\r\norganisasi, tanggapan mereka mengenai sokongan organisasi, dan perasaan mereka\r\nterhadap organisasi. Seramai 172 pekerja penyeliaan telah menilai gelagat\r\nkewarganegaraan subordinat mereka.
